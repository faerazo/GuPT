We are a joint department of two universities in Gothenburg: The University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. As the largest department in mathematical sciences in Sweden, we can offer a broad range of courses, which opens up opportunities for collaborations and several specializations. Our programme strives to be at the forefront of mathematical sciences and offers five specializations:\n\n- mathematics\n- applied mathematics\n- mathematical statistics\n- financial mathematics\n- statistical learning and AI\n\nTwo of these specializations are not commonly found in similar programmes: financial mathematics and statistical learning and AI.\n\n### Diverse options for future careers\n\nSome specializations are more theoretical and research-oriented and will prepare you for further research and a career in academia. Other specializations are geared more towards applied mathematics and better prepare you for work within the private sector but could also lead to an academic career. Some specializations, such as mathematical statistics, can be more theoretical or applied depending on your interests\n\nRead more about [Specializations](https://gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/specializations-mathematical-sciences )\n\n[What is it like to study in Gothenburg?

We emphasize problem solving in the form of assignments and smaller projects, where problems are presented that require solutions to be implemented with mathematical software (typically Matlab). One of the mandatory courses (Stochastic Optimization Algorithms) also emphasizes the importance of writing and examining structured program code. In several courses you will work in pairs or small groups. A seminar course spans the entire first year, and functions partly as an introduction, but above all provides training in presentation technology by systematically giving and receiving feedback on presentations. This course also includes an ethics element.\n\n### A dynamic and engaging community\n\nThe content of the programme is closely connected to the research on machine learning, genetics and turbulence, information theory, and adaptive systems and robotics performed at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. There is also a lively exchange with international research groups and regular guest lectures on current research that is often directly related to the course material.\n\n## Programme structure and content\n\nThe first year provides foundational knowledge of complex systems, and provides you the opportunity to design your education according to your own interests.

Data can be of many , such as biochemical measurements, questionnaire responses, scores, diagnoses, survival rates, genetic factors and molecular biological data, and vary in scope and collection methods.\n\nFor this volume of data to benefit society through development and innovations in both the public and private sectors, expertise is required to collect, manage, visualize, analyse using statistical methods, and draw conclusions based on extensive datasets.\n\nThe purpose of the program is to provide students with a broad and in-depth understanding of statistical methods, including insight into the limitations of these methods and their applicability to different types of data and research questions, as well as how results can be interpreted and generalized. Upon completion of the program, students will be familiar with all stages of a project involving statistical analysis of health-related data.",

Marine exploration continues at an unprecedented scale, as does the ever-increasing exploitation of the oceans. More than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered by oceans. The heat capacity of the oceans is several hundred times larger than the atmospheric, ocean primary production rivals the terrestrial, and 40% of the human population lives less than 50 kilometres from a coastline.\n\nWith the ocean such an integral part\u202fof human life and society, the demand for skilled marine scientists capable of addressing increasing complex problems is growing, with more diverse, challenging, and interesting opportunities compared to just ten years ago. You will gain broad insights to the ocean as a system and graduate armed with the analytical tools and skills necessary to take on complex projects for a wide variety of employers.\n\n### A comprehensive and interdisciplinary programme\n\nThe Department of Marine Sciences harbours all disciplines of marine research: physical oceanography, marine biology, marine chemistry, marine geology, and even conservation of marine heritage. Our approach to the ocean is system oriented and interdisciplinary. We base this approach on the notion that the ocean is different from terrestrial systems in many fundamental ways.\n\nWe have highly qualified lecturers in all core disciplines, positioning themselves and the department at the forefront internationally. The lecturers are well connected nationally as well as internationally, and it is not uncommon for students to pursue part of their education in another university or country.\n\n### Rich and dynamic field work",

People with knowledge of how to process and analyse large amounts of data are becoming increasingly sought after. This full-time on-campus programme consists of courses in applied data science and related subjects.\n\n## About\n\nData science is concerned with extracting meaning from large volumes of data. It is a field that has grown rapidly in recent years as a result of the increasing availability of large data sets and the opportunities and challenges that they present. Central topics within data science include data mining, machine learning, databases, and the application of data science methods in natural sciences, life sciences, business, humanities, and social sciences, as well as in industry and society.\n\n[Watch our film about the programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KVxug8RomY)\n\n### Training in the management and analysis of large-scale data\n\nData science is having a big impact on industry. For some companies, being able to handle and analyse massive data sets is central to their business model. Even for other companies, being able to extract information from data (for example, data about customers) can offer crucial competitive advantages. People with knowledge and skills in data science are therefore in high demand, in Gothenburg, in Sweden, and internationally. Similarly, within scientific research, data-intensive scientific discovery is increasingly important in many areas, and researchers need to be able to handle and analyse massive data sets.\n\n### Welcoming students with backgrounds in many different areas",
