We are a joint department of two universities in Gothenburg: The University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. As the largest department in mathematical sciences in Sweden, we can offer a broad range of courses, which opens up opportunities for collaborations and several specializations. Our programme strives to be at the forefront of mathematical sciences and offers five specializations:\n\n- mathematics\n- applied mathematics\n- mathematical statistics\n- financial mathematics\n- statistical learning and AI\n\nTwo of these specializations are not commonly found in similar programmes: financial mathematics and statistical learning and AI.\n\n### Diverse options for future careers\n\nSome specializations are more theoretical and research-oriented and will prepare you for further research and a career in academia. Other specializations are geared more towards applied mathematics and better prepare you for work within the private sector but could also lead to an academic career. Some specializations, such as mathematical statistics, can be more theoretical or applied depending on your interests\n\nRead more about [Specializations](https://gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/specializations-mathematical-sciences )\n\n[What is it like to study in Gothenburg?

We emphasize problem solving in the form of assignments and smaller projects, where problems are presented that require solutions to be implemented with mathematical software (typically Matlab). One of the mandatory courses (Stochastic Optimization Algorithms) also emphasizes the importance of writing and examining structured program code. In several courses you will work in pairs or small groups. A seminar course spans the entire first year, and functions partly as an introduction, but above all provides training in presentation technology by systematically giving and receiving feedback on presentations. This course also includes an ethics element.\n\n### A dynamic and engaging community\n\nThe content of the programme is closely connected to the research on machine learning, genetics and turbulence, information theory, and adaptive systems and robotics performed at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. There is also a lively exchange with international research groups and regular guest lectures on current research that is often directly related to the course material.\n\n## Programme structure and content\n\nThe first year provides foundational knowledge of complex systems, and provides you the opportunity to design your education according to your own interests.

Data can be of many , such as biochemical measurements, questionnaire responses, scores, diagnoses, survival rates, genetic factors and molecular biological data, and vary in scope and collection methods.\n\nFor this volume of data to benefit society through development and innovations in both the public and private sectors, expertise is required to collect, manage, visualize, analyse using statistical methods, and draw conclusions based on extensive datasets.\n\nThe purpose of the program is to provide students with a broad and in-depth understanding of statistical methods, including insight into the limitations of these methods and their applicability to different types of data and research questions, as well as how results can be interpreted and generalized. Upon completion of the program, students will be familiar with all stages of a project involving statistical analysis of health-related data.",

Marine exploration continues at an unprecedented scale, as does the ever-increasing exploitation of the oceans. More than 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered by oceans. The heat capacity of the oceans is several hundred times larger than the atmospheric, ocean primary production rivals the terrestrial, and 40% of the human population lives less than 50 kilometres from a coastline.\n\nWith the ocean such an integral part\u202fof human life and society, the demand for skilled marine scientists capable of addressing increasing complex problems is growing, with more diverse, challenging, and interesting opportunities compared to just ten years ago. You will gain broad insights to the ocean as a system and graduate armed with the analytical tools and skills necessary to take on complex projects for a wide variety of employers.\n\n### A comprehensive and interdisciplinary programme\n\nThe Department of Marine Sciences harbours all disciplines of marine research: physical oceanography, marine biology, marine chemistry, marine geology, and even conservation of marine heritage. Our approach to the ocean is system oriented and interdisciplinary. We base this approach on the notion that the ocean is different from terrestrial systems in many fundamental ways.\n\nWe have highly qualified lecturers in all core disciplines, positioning themselves and the department at the forefront internationally. The lecturers are well connected nationally as well as internationally, and it is not uncommon for students to pursue part of their education in another university or country.\n\n### Rich and dynamic field work",

People with knowledge of how to process and analyse large amounts of data are becoming increasingly sought after. This full-time on-campus programme consists of courses in applied data science and related subjects.\n\n## About\n\nData science is concerned with extracting meaning from large volumes of data. It is a field that has grown rapidly in recent years as a result of the increasing availability of large data sets and the opportunities and challenges that they present. Central topics within data science include data mining, machine learning, databases, and the application of data science methods in natural sciences, life sciences, business, humanities, and social sciences, as well as in industry and society.\n\n[Watch our film about the programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KVxug8RomY)\n\n### Training in the management and analysis of large-scale data\n\nData science is having a big impact on industry. For some companies, being able to handle and analyse massive data sets is central to their business model. Even for other companies, being able to extract information from data (for example, data about customers) can offer crucial competitive advantages. People with knowledge and skills in data science are therefore in high demand, in Gothenburg, in Sweden, and internationally. Similarly, within scientific research, data-intensive scientific discovery is increasingly important in many areas, and researchers need to be able to handle and analyse massive data sets.\n\n### Welcoming students with backgrounds in many different areas",

Example of topics are methods for handling incomplete data, more advanced regression models, and causal inference with methods for mapping causal relationships and concepts such as confounding factors, mediation, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and propensity score.\n\nAdditionally, statistical learning is a component of the second semester, covering principles and methods for both unsupervised and supervised learning in regression, classification and clustering, as well as general principles for evaluating predictive analysis and model performance. An important part of the second semester is also a course focusing on health data and questionnaires, which deepens the understanding of handling and analysing data structures typical for medical research and development projects. This includes knowledge and management of registry data and composite outcomes, as well as evaluation of questionnaires, health instruments and scores.

We emphasize problem solving in the form of assignments and smaller projects, where problems are presented that require solutions to be implemented with mathematical software (typically Matlab). One of the mandatory courses (Stochastic Optimization Algorithms) also emphasizes the importance of writing and examining structured program code. In several courses you will work in pairs or small groups. A seminar course spans the entire first year, and functions partly as an introduction, but above all provides training in presentation technology by systematically giving and receiving feedback on presentations. This course also includes an ethics element.\n\n### A dynamic and engaging community\n\nThe content of the programme is closely connected to the research on machine learning, genetics and turbulence, information theory, and adaptive systems and robotics performed at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. There is also a lively exchange with international research groups and regular guest lectures on current research that is often directly related to the course material.\n\n## Programme structure and content\n\nThe first year provides foundational knowledge of complex systems, and provides you the opportunity to design your education according to your own interests. The first semester contains four recommended courses:\n\n- Neural Networks\n- Stochastic Optimization Algorithms\n- Simulation of Complex Systems\n- Dynamical Systems\n\nThe second semester has one recommended course, Computational Biology, and the opportunity to choose elective courses.

Data can be of many , such as biochemical measurements, questionnaire responses, scores, diagnoses, survival rates, genetic factors and molecular biological data, and vary in scope and collection methods.\n\nFor this volume of data to benefit society through development and innovations in both the public and private sectors, expertise is required to collect, manage, visualize, analyse using statistical methods, and draw conclusions based on extensive datasets.\n\nThe purpose of the program is to provide students with a broad and in-depth understanding of statistical methods, including insight into the limitations of these methods and their applicability to different types of data and research questions, as well as how results can be interpreted and generalized. Upon completion of the program, students will be familiar with all stages of a project involving statistical analysis of health-related data.",

International trade, social and economic development, environmental protection, human rights, security, democratisation, state capacity development, and gender equality are all increasingly treated at the regional, transnational and international levels. In our programme, we explore and analyse the intentional and unintentional effects of both action and inaction by entities from international organisations and states to epistemic communities, NGOs, and citizen activists.\n\n### A wide-ranging and interdisciplinary learning experience\n\nThe programme is offered jointly by the Department of Economics, the Department of Political Science, and the School of Global Studies. Throughout the programme, you will explore the historical development of the international system, critically examining the interrelations among actors on the international arena through various theoretical lenses. Building on this foundation, the programme explores specific policy issues in the broad areas of security, and environmental, economic, social, and political development.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Why do some societal issues make it onto the international policy agenda while other, equally compelling, issues do not?\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What implications do international trade agreements have for producers, consumers, and the environment?

Our programme strives to be at the forefront of mathematical sciences and offers five specializations:\n\n- mathematics\n- applied mathematics\n- mathematical statistics\n- financial mathematics\n- statistical learning and AI\n\nTwo of these specializations are not commonly found in similar programmes: financial mathematics and statistical learning and AI.\n\n### Diverse options for future careers\n\nSome specializations are more theoretical and research-oriented and will prepare you for further research and a career in academia. Other specializations are geared more towards applied mathematics and better prepare you for work within the private sector but could also lead to an academic career. Some specializations, such as mathematical statistics, can be more theoretical or applied depending on your interests\n\nRead more about [Specializations](https://gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/specializations-mathematical-sciences )\n\n[What is it like to study in Gothenburg? Ask our international students!](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/contact-a-student)\n\n## Programme structure and content\n\nThere is a high degree of freedom and flexibility in our programme. There is one mandatory course for all specializations: Perspectives in Mathematics. There are two exclusive courses\u2014closed to students outside our programme\u2014that are based on solving real-world problems from industrial partners:",

Central topics within data science include data mining, machine learning, databases, and the application of data science methods in natural sciences, life sciences, business, humanities, and social sciences, as well as in industry and society.\n\n[Watch our film about the programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KVxug8RomY)\n\n### Training in the management and analysis of large-scale data\n\nData science is having a big impact on industry. For some companies, being able to handle and analyse massive data sets is central to their business model. Even for other companies, being able to extract information from data (for example, data about customers) can offer crucial competitive advantages. People with knowledge and skills in data science are therefore in high demand, in Gothenburg, in Sweden, and internationally. Similarly, within scientific research, data-intensive scientific discovery is increasingly important in many areas, and researchers need to be able to handle and analyse massive data sets.\n\n### Welcoming students with backgrounds in many different areas",

We are a joint department of two universities in Gothenburg: The University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. As the largest department in mathematical sciences in Sweden, we can offer a broad range of courses, which opens up opportunities for collaborations and several specializations. Our programme strives to be at the forefront of mathematical sciences and offers five specializations:\n\n- mathematics\n- applied mathematics\n- mathematical statistics\n- financial mathematics\n- statistical learning and AI\n\nTwo of these specializations are not commonly found in similar programmes: financial mathematics and statistical learning and AI.\n\n### Diverse options for future careers\n\nSome specializations are more theoretical and research-oriented and will prepare you for further research and a career in academia. Other specializations are geared more towards applied mathematics and better prepare you for work within the private sector but could also lead to an academic career. Some specializations, such as mathematical statistics, can be more theoretical or applied depending on your interests\n\nRead more about [Specializations](https://gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/specializations-mathematical-sciences )\n\n[What is it like to study in Gothenburg?

We emphasize problem solving in the form of assignments and smaller projects, where problems are presented that require solutions to be implemented with mathematical software (typically Matlab). One of the mandatory courses (Stochastic Optimization Algorithms) also emphasizes the importance of writing and examining structured program code. In several courses you will work in pairs or small groups. A seminar course spans the entire first year, and functions partly as an introduction, but above all provides training in presentation technology by systematically giving and receiving feedback on presentations. This course also includes an ethics element.\n\n### A dynamic and engaging community\n\nThe content of the programme is closely connected to the research on machine learning, genetics and turbulence, information theory, and adaptive systems and robotics performed at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg. There is also a lively exchange with international research groups and regular guest lectures on current research that is often directly related to the course material.\n\n## Programme structure and content\n\nThe first year provides foundational knowledge of complex systems, and provides you the opportunity to design your education according to your own interests. The first semester contains four recommended courses:\n\n- Neural Networks\n- Stochastic Optimization Algorithms\n- Simulation of Complex Systems\n- Dynamical Systems\n\nThe second semester has one recommended course, Computational Biology, and the opportunity to choose elective courses.

The programme provides you with the analytical skills to understand the complexity of global challenges as well as the capacity to identify political alternatives to address them. As a genuinely interdisciplinary and multi-perspective field, Global Studies helps you examine and comprehend the transnational features\u2014those that cut across categories such as local, state, regional, international, private, public\u2014of the political, social, economic, and environmental dynamics that characterize today\u2019s planetary challenges. Understanding how they have unfolded over time and in context with other factors such as the emergence of secularization, the \u2018modern\u2019 state, capitalism, or imperialism, builds the foundation for in-depth inquiries. In addition, the student-centered and inclusive approach to teaching and learning constitutes the perfect environment for you to translate such understandings into ways to develop society towards fair and equitable socio-ecological solutions.

This is followed by a course in study design and experimental planning, including an introduction to epidemiology, and a course in regression analysis that forms the foundation for several of the advanced courses in biostatistical methods.\n\nThe second semester includes advanced courses in the main field, which together provide comprehensive and in-depth methodological knowledge in biostatistics, with an increased understanding of statistical modelling, and the application of various methods in medical research and life sciences. Example of topics are methods for handling incomplete data, more advanced regression models, and causal inference with methods for mapping causal relationships and concepts such as confounding factors, mediation, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and propensity score.\n\nAdditionally, statistical learning is a component of the second semester, covering principles and methods for both unsupervised and supervised learning in regression, classification and clustering, as well as general principles for evaluating predictive analysis and model performance. An important part of the second semester is also a course focusing on health data and questionnaires, which deepens the understanding of handling and analysing data structures typical for medical research and development projects. This includes knowledge and management of registry data and composite outcomes, as well as evaluation of questionnaires, health instruments and scores. The course enhances skills in R programming and supports the student\u2019s development towards a professional role as an independent, applied biostatistician capable of handling all stages of data analysis.",

In short, theory provides models and concepts that can explain and predict experimental observations. Computers allow for numerical computation of the fundamental laws of physics and advanced techniques, such as machine learning. Using advanced instrumentation, both in-house and at large facilities like Onsala Space Observatory, will provide you with in-depth knowledge of material and biological systems, and of distant stars and galaxies.\n\nOur programme will develop your understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and how they are related to the smallest and most fundamental building blocks. Much of the physics and technology that we meet in everyday life falls into the category of condensed matter physics, and there are many exciting areas within physics where you can study the interaction between atoms or molecules and the consequences. There is also strong development in the areas bordering on chemistry and biology. A further concept is that of complex systems, which involves financial and societal systems in addition to physical, chemical, or biological systems.\n\nThe core courses of the programme provide you with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of physics, preparing you for a future driven by knowledge and technology. We offer five specializations to build upon this foundation, and recommend you choose two of the following to focus on: astronomy, biological physics, computational physics, high-energy physics, materials science",

With the support of our [Advisory Industry Panel](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/master-in-communication-industry-advisory-panel), we are committed to continuously improving the quality of the program and its ability to provide up-to-date communication skills and competences that are most needed in the current and future job market. You can choose an educational path that interests you after gaining advanced knowledge and skills in two areas of specialisation:\n\n- Digital communication examines the role of digital technologies in communication\u2014how they shape communication and how we can use them to study communication. This area of specialisation deals with how the continued digitalisation of society affects communication, for example, how emerging practices like wikis and memes challenge long-held assumptions concerning authorship. Another topic of study is how digital technologies can be used to study communication, for example analysing big textual data for sentiment in online communities.\n\n- Organisational communication focuses on issues, approaches to, and challenges of communication within organisations, and between organisations and external stakeholders, including related fields such as corporate communication, public relations, and strategic communication. The programme addresses the unique challenges that organisations face in communicating with different external and internal stakeholders. It will also enable students to effectively implement a variety of communication techniques used in professional settings.\n\n### A multicultural learning environment committed to sustainability, equality and inclusion",

With increasing connection and communication, however, the possibilities of misinformation, cyber-attacks, and breaches of privacy grow. On the other hand, aspects of life such as travel have never been more accessible, from air travel to self-driving cars. Algorithms steer our lives, influencing where we shop and what we buy, how we learn and how we communicate. At its core, computer science is the science of programming, studying the general powers and limitations of computing, the design and characteristics of hardware and software, and the solving of problems in applications of computers.\n\n### A full-spectrum master\u2019s programme\n\nWe have strong, internationally recognized research groups driving our programme, addressing a wide range of questions including the properties of electronic devices, the character of human reasoning, individual design components, globally distributed systems, fundamental understanding of computation, and highly pragmatic, applied research.\n\nYou can choose courses from a wide range of areas:",

What makes a paradox paradoxical but a mathematical proof acceptable? What does it mean for a program to be bug-free? Logic is the study of all these questions, and of reasoning in general.\n\nYou will be prepared to follow both academic career paths and employment in a diverse array of fields, including software engineering and computational linguistics. You will participate in interdisciplinary collaboration within a dynamic research community.\n\n## About\n\nDo you see yourself thriving in an environment that fuses striking mathematical methodology and profound philosophical insights?\u00a0 Logic has developed beyond the traditional definition as the study of formal aspects of valid reasoning to be more widely applicable not only in the neighbouring disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, and computer science, but also in industry and engineering. As a student of the programme, you will get a thorough education in the core topics in logic and will have the opportunity to explore applications in diverse areas including natural language processing, database design, and artificial intelligence. Although the programme is in this sense multidisciplinary, the core components are in mathematical logic.\n\n### Unique interdisciplinary opportunities",

      "answer": "The Human-Robot Interaction Design course (DIT007) at the University of Gothenburg is about the research and development of robots ranging from domestic robots, autonomous robotic agents, virtual agents, to industrial robots. It focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), which is concerned with how to design, develop, and evaluate robotic agents with the user in the loop.\n\nSpecifically, the course introduces HRI design practices, evaluation methods, and approaches. It applies human-centered approaches to design for:\n\n1. The abilities to consider in a robot,\n2. The interaction modalities a robot should have,\n3. The form and appearance of a robot.\n\nThe course also provides an understanding of the impact robots can have on society and emphasizes the importance of ethical and critical considerations when designing robots.\n\nPrerequisites include having a Bachelor's degree of 180 credits and a course in Human-Computer Interaction of 7.5 credits.

      "answer": "The Human-Robot Interaction Design course (DIT007) at the University of Gothenburg is a Master's level course worth 7.5 credits (ECTS), offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Science and Technology.\n\nThe course introduces the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), which is concerned with how to design, develop, and evaluate robotic agents with the user in the loop. It covers HRI design practices, evaluation methods, and approaches. Specifically, the course applies human-centered approaches to design focusing on:\n\n1. The abilities to consider in a robot,\n2. The interaction modalities a robot should have,\n3. The form and appearance of a robot.\n\nAdditionally, the course provides an understanding of the impact robots can have on society and emphasizes the importance of ethical and critical considerations when designing robots.\n\nEntry requirements include having a Bachelor's degree of 180 credits and a course in Human-Computer Interaction of 7.5 credits. Applicants must also prove knowledge of English at the level of English 6/English B or equivalent.\n\nSelection is based on the number of credits from previous university studies, with a maximum of 285 credits.\n\nThe course is conducted on campus in G\u00f6teborg during the spring 2025 semester, with a study pace of 50%, held during the day from 24 March 2025 to 8 June 2025. The language of instruction is English.\n\nFor more detailed course content, the syllabus is available here: [Syllabus, English, DIT007 (pdf)](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT007).\n\nSources:\n\u2022 advanced-requirements-engineering-dit285.md\n\u2022 advanced-topics-in-probability-syllabus-msf600.md\n<details><summary>**See 41 more sources...**</summary>\n\n\u2022 agile-software-project-management-dit257.md\n\u2022 applied-machine-learning-dit867.md\n\u2022 artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems-lt2918.md\n\u2022 behavioral-software-engineering-dit849.md\n\u2022 biodiversity-patterns-and-processes-syllabus-bio411.md\n\u2022 climate-modelling-syllabus-gvn465.md\n\u2022 computer-communication-dit423.md\n\u2022 computer-networks-dit671.md\n\u2022 concept-driven-interaction-design-dit666.md\n\u2022 cultural-perspectives-on-gender-and-families-syllabus-kvl195.md\n\u2022 data-analysis-for-earth-sciences-syllabus-gv2500.md\n\u2022 data-and-society-tia125.md\n\u2022 data-driven-support-for-cyber-physical-systems-dit616.md\n\u2022 dependable-real-time-systems-dit173.md\n\u2022 design-and-ai-tig330.md\n\u2022 design-and-construction-of-digital-games-dit414.md\n\u2022 dialogue-systems-2-lt2319.md\n\u2022 earth-systems-field-course-syllabus-gvn470.md\n\u2022 environmental-politics-in-theory-and-practice-syllabus-sk1138.md\n\u2022 european-heritage-and-identity-syllabus-eu2112.md\n\u2022 formal-methods-in-software-development-dit272.md\n\u2022 gameplay-design-dit098.md\n\u2022 globalization-poverty-and-international-social-work-syllabus-sw2277.md\n\u2022 human-computer-interaction-dit096.md\n\u2022 human-robot-interaction-design-dit007.md\n\u2022 humanoid-robotics-fim800.md\n\u2022 institutional-development-and-democratization-in-international-perspective-syllabus-sk1227.md\n\u2022 integrating-european-markets-syllabus-eu2122.md\n\u2022 interaction-design-methodology-dit104.md\n\u2022 introduction-to-data-science-and-ai-dit407.md\n\u2022 mobile-computing-design-and-implementation-dit075.md\n\u2022 prototyping-in-interaction-design-dit176.md\n\u2022 real-time-systems-dit162.md\n\u2022 research-foundations-in-the-digitalization-of-society-tig150.md\n\u2022 social-europe-syllabus-eu2220.md\n\u2022 software-development-methodologies-dit348.md\n\u2022 tangible-interaction-dit107.md\n\u2022 technology-politics-society-gs2236.md\n\u2022 the-european-unions-role-in-international-affairs-syllabus-eu1145.md\n\u2022 varieties-of-democracy-and-democratization-syllabus-sk2222.md\n\u2022 web-applications-dit127.md\n</details>"

      "answer": "The Human-Robot Interaction Design (DIT007) course at the University of Gothenburg is about the research and development of robots, ranging from domestic robots, autonomous robotic agents, virtual agents, to industrial robots. It focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), which is concerned with how to design, develop, and evaluate robotic agents with the user in the loop.\n\nSpecifically, the course introduces HRI design practices, evaluation methods, and approaches. It applies human-centered approaches to design for:\n\n1. The abilities to consider in a robot,\n2. The interaction modalities a robot should have,\n3. The form and appearance of a robot.\n\nAdditionally, the course provides an understanding of the impact robots can have on society and emphasizes the importance of ethical and critical considerations when designing robots.\n\nThe course is at the Master's level, worth 7.5 credits (ECTS), offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Science and Technology. It is taught in English, conducted on campus in G\u00f6teborg, and scheduled for Spring 2025.\n\nEntry requirements include having a Bachelor's degree of 180 credits and a course in Human-Computer Interaction of 7.5 credits. Applicants must also prove knowledge of English at the level of English 6/English B or equivalent.\n\nSelection is based on the number of credits from previous university studies, with a maximum of 285 credits.\n\nThis information is based on the course description provided in the source documents.\n\nSources:\n\u2022 advanced-requirements-engineering-dit285.md\n\u2022 advanced-topics-in-probability-syllabus-msf600.md\n<details><summary>**See 38 more sources...**</summary>\n\n\u2022 agile-software-project-management-dit257.md\n\u2022 applied-machine-learning-dit867.md\n\u2022 artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems-lt2918.md\n\u2022 behavioral-software-engineering-dit849.md\n\u2022 biodiversity-patterns-and-processes-syllabus-bio411.md\n\u2022 climate-modelling-syllabus-gvn465.md\n\u2022 computational-semantics-lt2813.md\n\u2022 computer-communication-dit423.md\n\u2022 computer-networks-dit671.md\n\u2022 concept-driven-interaction-design-dit666.md\n\u2022 cultural-perspectives-on-gender-and-families-syllabus-kvl195.md\n\u2022 data-and-society-tia125.md\n\u2022 data-driven-support-for-cyber-physical-systems-dit616.md\n\u2022 dependable-real-time-systems-dit173.md\n\u2022 design-and-ai-tig330.md\n\u2022 design-and-construction-of-digital-games-dit414.md\n\u2022 earth-systems-field-course-syllabus-gvn470.md\n\u2022 european-heritage-and-identity-syllabus-eu2112.md\n\u2022 formal-methods-in-software-development-dit272.md\n\u2022 fundamentals-of-software-architecture-dit345.md\n\u2022 globalization-poverty-and-international-social-work-syllabus-sw2277.md\n\u2022 human-computer-interaction-dit096.md\n\u2022 human-robot-interaction-design-dit007.md\n\u2022 humanoid-robotics-fim800.md\n\u2022 integrating-european-markets-syllabus-eu2122.md\n\u2022 interaction-design-methodology-dit104.md\n\u2022 introduction-to-data-science-and-ai-dit407.md\n\u2022 mobile-computing-design-and-implementation-dit075.md\n\u2022 network-security-dit071.md\n\u2022 principles-of-concurrent-programming-dit392.md\n\u2022 prototyping-in-interaction-design-dit176.md\n\u2022 real-time-systems-dit162.md\n\u2022 research-foundations-in-the-digitalization-of-society-tig150.md\n\u2022 software-development-methodologies-dit348.md\n\u2022 tangible-interaction-dit107.md\n\u2022 the-european-unions-role-in-international-affairs-syllabus-eu1145.md\n\u2022 varieties-of-democracy-and-democratization-syllabus-sk2222.md\n\u2022 web-applications-dit127.md\n</details>"

      "answer": "The Computer Architecture course (DIT051) at the University of Gothenburg is a 7.5 credits course that covers architectural techniques necessary to achieve high performance for user programs. It also covers simulation-based analysis methods for quantitative assessment of the impact of a particular architectural technique on performance.\n\nThe content is divided into the following parts:\n\n1. Aspects affecting the development of computer technology including Moore's Law, performance measures (execution time vs. throughput), benchmarking, and fundamentals of computer performance such as Amdahl's Law and memory access locality.\n\n2. Various techniques for exploiting instruction level parallelism (ILP) by defining key concepts of what ILP is and what limits it. The techniques covered fall into two categories: dynamic and static techniques. The main dynamic techniques covered are Tomasulo's algorithm, branch prediction and speculation. The most important static techniques are loop unrolling, software pipelining, trace scheduling and predicated instructions.\n\n3. Principles of modern memory hierarchies such as inclusive and non-inclusive memory hierarchies, lockup free caching techniques, prefetching, classification of cache misses.\n\n4. Multi-core microprocessors and techniques such as multi-threading and cache coherence.\n\nA common thread running through all content parts is a discussion of cost tradeoffs with respect to performance, power, energy, verifiability, programmability, and maintainability. A second unifying theme is the memory bottleneck, and the importance of efficient resource management.\n\nPrerequisites: The course DIT051 Computer Architecture, 7.5 credits, or equivalent, is required.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits.\n\nFor more details, see the syllabus: [Syllabus, English, DIT051 (pdf)](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT051)\n\nSources:\n\u2022 advanced-computer-graphics-dit227.md\n\u2022 advanced-topics-in-probability-syllabus-msf600.md\n<details><summary>**See 48 more sources...**</summary>\n\n\u2022 agile-software-project-management-dit257.md\n\u2022 applied-mathematical-thinking-dit026.md\n\u2022 biodiversity-patterns-and-processes-project-syllabus-bio412.md\n\u2022 biodiversity-patterns-and-processes-syllabus-bio411.md\n\u2022 climate-modelling-syllabus-gvn465.md\n\u2022 compiler-construction-dit301.md\n\u2022 computability-dit313.md\n\u2022 computational-methods-in-bioinformatics-dit743.md\n\u2022 computer-architecture-dit051.md\n\u2022 computer-communication-dit423.md\n\u2022 computer-networks-dit671.md\n\u2022 cryptography-dit352.md\n\u2022 cultural-perspectives-on-gender-and-families-syllabus-kvl195.md\n\u2022 data-analysis-for-earth-sciences-syllabus-gv2500.md\n\u2022 data-driven-support-for-cyber-physical-systems-dit616.md\n\u2022 dependable-real-time-systems-dit173.md\n\u2022 design-and-ai-tig330.md\n\u2022 digital-design-dit798.md\n\u2022 distributed-systems-advanced-course-dit290.md\n\u2022 europe-in-the-world-syllabus-eu2215.md\n\u2022 european-heritage-and-identity-syllabus-eu2112.md\n\u2022 finite-automata-and-formal-languages-dit323.md\n\u2022 formal-methods-in-software-development-dit272.md\n\u2022 fundamentals-of-software-architecture-dit345.md\n\u2022 game-engine-architecture-dit572.md\n\u2022 globalization-poverty-and-international-social-work-syllabus-sw2277.md\n\u2022 integrating-european-markets-syllabus-eu2122.md\n\u2022 interaction-design-methodology-dit104.md\n\u2022 language-based-security-dit101.md\n\u2022 logic-in-computer-science-dit203.md\n\u2022 network-security-dit071.md\n\u2022 parallel-computer-architecture-dit362.md\n\u2022 political-psychology-syllabus-px2116.md\n\u2022 principles-of-concurrent-programming-dit392.md\n\u2022 programming-language-technology-dit231.md\n\u2022 real-time-systems-dit162.md\n\u2022 sedimentology-and-stratigraphy-syllabus-gvg300.md\n\u2022 social-europe-syllabus-eu2220.md\n\u2022 software-development-methodologies-dit348.md\n\u2022 sustainable-computing-dit056.md\n\u2022 tangible-interaction-dit107.md\n\u2022 testing-debugging-and-verification-dit084.md\n\u2022 the-european-unions-role-in-international-affairs-syllabus-eu1145.md\n\u2022 the-handmaids-tale-as-dystopian-diagnostics-reading-global-politics-through-popular-culture-gs1613.md\n\u2022 the-performance-of-democracies-syllabus-sk2211.md\n\u2022 types-for-programs-and-proofs-dit235.md\n\u2022 varieties-of-democracy-and-democratization-syllabus-sk2222.md\n\u2022 web-applications-dit127.md\n</details>"

      "answer": "The Human-Robot Interaction Design course (DIT007) at the University of Gothenburg is about the research and development of robots, including domestic robots, autonomous robotic agents, virtual agents, and industrial robots. It focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), which is concerned with how to design, develop, and evaluate robotic agents with the user in the loop.\n\nThe course introduces HRI design practices, evaluation methods, and approaches. Specifically, it applies human-centered approaches to design for:\n\n1. The abilities to consider in a robot,\n2. The interaction modalities a robot should have,\n3. The form and appearance of a robot.\n\nAdditionally, the course provides an understanding of the impact robots can have on society and emphasizes the importance of ethical and critical considerations when designing robots.\n\nEntry requirements include having a Bachelor's degree of 180 credits and a course in Human-Computer Interaction of 7.5 credits. Applicants must also prove knowledge of English.\n\nSelection is based on the number of credits from previous university studies, with a maximum of 285 credits.\n\nThe course is offered at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, is at the Master's level, worth 7.5 ECTS credits, taught in English, and held on campus in G\u00f6teborg during the spring 2025 semester.\n\nSources:\n\u2022 advanced-requirements-engineering-dit285.md\n\u2022 advanced-topics-in-probability-syllabus-msf600.md\n<details><summary>**See 46 more sources...**</summary>\n\n\u2022 african-languages-data-and-method-af2213.md\n\u2022 agile-software-project-management-dit257.md\n\u2022 applied-machine-learning-dit867.md\n\u2022 art-and-politics-on-friendship-and-the-political-imaginary-fkakpo.md\n\u2022 artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems-lt2918.md\n\u2022 behavioral-software-engineering-dit849.md\n\u2022 biodiversity-patterns-and-processes-syllabus-bio411.md\n\u2022 bioinformatics-and-functional-genomics-bio210.md\n\u2022 climate-modelling-syllabus-gvn465.md\n\u2022 computational-semantics-lt2813.md\n\u2022 computer-networks-dit671.md\n\u2022 concept-driven-interaction-design-dit666.md\n\u2022 cultural-perspectives-on-gender-and-families-syllabus-kvl195.md\n\u2022 data-analysis-for-earth-sciences-syllabus-gv2500.md\n\u2022 data-and-society-tia125.md\n\u2022 data-driven-support-for-cyber-physical-systems-dit616.md\n\u2022 dependable-real-time-systems-dit173.md\n\u2022 design-and-ai-tig330.md\n\u2022 design-and-construction-of-digital-games-dit414.md\n\u2022 dialogue-systems-2-lt2319.md\n\u2022 earth-systems-field-course-syllabus-gvn470.md\n\u2022 eat-food-culture-materiality-and-design-fkgeat.md\n\u2022 european-heritage-and-identity-syllabus-eu2112.md\n\u2022 formal-methods-in-software-development-dit272.md\n\u2022 gameplay-design-dit098.md\n\u2022 globalization-poverty-and-international-social-work-syllabus-sw2277.md\n\u2022 human-computer-interaction-dit096.md\n\u2022 human-robot-interaction-design-dit007.md\n\u2022 humanoid-robotics-fim800.md\n\u2022 individual-project-work-1-vsind1.md\n\u2022 institutional-development-and-democratization-in-international-perspective-syllabus-sk1227.md\n\u2022 integrating-european-markets-syllabus-eu2122.md\n\u2022 interaction-design-methodology-dit104.md\n\u2022 introduction-to-data-science-and-ai-dit407.md\n\u2022 mobile-computing-design-and-implementation-dit075.md\n\u2022 political-science-analysis-syllabus-sk2121.md\n\u2022 prototyping-in-interaction-design-dit176.md\n\u2022 real-time-systems-dit162.md\n\u2022 social-europe-syllabus-eu2220.md\n\u2022 software-development-methodologies-dit348.md\n\u2022 tangible-interaction-dit107.md\n\u2022 technology-politics-society-gs2236.md\n\u2022 the-european-unions-role-in-international-affairs-syllabus-eu1145.md\n\u2022 the-handmaids-tale-as-dystopian-diagnostics-reading-global-politics-through-popular-culture-gs1613.md\n\u2022 varieties-of-democracy-and-democratization-syllabus-sk2222.md\n\u2022 web-applications-dit127.md\n</details>"
