## About

The course aims to enhance and improve your critical skills in applying various linguistic paradigms to the analysis of naturally occurring, real-life linguistic data (for example various forms of so-called interactional data such as face-to-face conversations or interactions via new media technologies, among others).

You will learn/practice a number of different theoretical and methodological approaches to linguistic analysis (e.g. cognitive, pragmatic, corpus-based, sociolinguistic, etc.) in relation to specific linguistic issues. Each approach is presented and discussed as regards its potential advantages, drawbacks and limitations. You thereafter practice ways to integrate and synthesize these different approaches in order to produce a more holistic application of different paradigms.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The requirement for admission to the course is a Bachelor's degree, 15 credits of which must be in Linguistics. These 15 credits may consist of linguistically oriented courses either in the major subject Linguistics or in a language subject (English, German, etc), for example sociology of language, grammar, phonetics. In addition, English 6/IELTS 6.5/TOEFL 580 is required in all parts, or the equivalent.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

What happens next? Further studies? Apply for a degree? Search for a job? How can you plan forwards to get your dream job?
