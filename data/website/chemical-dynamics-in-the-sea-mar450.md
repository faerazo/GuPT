## About

The course covers the extensive interactions between chemical, biological and geological processes in the ocean and its margins. Within this framework, the course focuses on the theory, practice and applications of marine chemistry. The major part of the course centers on planning, executing and reporting an expedition on the University´s new research vessel. This involves both group and individual projects assignments.

Background to this project work is provided in the form of lectures covering the analytical challenges facing marine chemists, together with an overview of key chemical processes in coastal systems. The role of marine chemistry in current global research projects is also presented.

- Lectures: analytical methods for marine chemistry, standards and traceability, marine pollution, marine organic matter, metal speciation and pelagic and benthic processes, the role of marine chemistry in Future Earth projects and other global projects.
- Individual projects: (the main part of the course) are centered around the Skagerak expedition.
