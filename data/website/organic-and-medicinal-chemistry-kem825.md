## About

The course in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the synthesis of drug-like molecules and concepts of medicinal chemistry..

After completing the course, you should possess the knowledge and experimental skills in organic chemistry required to be able to implement, plan, produce and analyse drug substances.

You should be able to:

- at a general level explain selected drug structure, pharmacological effects as well as function at molecular level
- at a general level explain interaction between drug molecules and receptors (biological targets)
- describe methods for lead generation and optimization of lead compounds
- plan and carry out production of drug molecules via multistage synthesis
- characterize the received substances with appropriate methods
- critically review results from own laboratory sessions as well as results from research literature
- assess and prevent security threats in connection with all activities that include organic compounds.

The knowledge obtained in this course is necessary for continued higher studies in organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.

### Teaching

Teaching includes lectures, tutorials and laboratory work.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The students must have studied KEM815 and passed the small tests within this course. The practical laboratory part must also be passed. Students with equal qualifications can be admitted.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor’s programme in Chemistry (N1KEM)
- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)
- Master's programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (N2KEL).

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

After completion of your education, you can work in different types of chemistry companies, food companies or analysis and synthesis laboratories, with laboratory work as well as research and development.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
