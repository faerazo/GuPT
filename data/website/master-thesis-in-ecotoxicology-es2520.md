## Summary

The degree course gives you in-depth knowledge of ecotoxicology in a specific topic that you have chosen together with your supervisor. The course prepare you for PhD education in ecotoxicology as well as for work outside the academia. Special emphasis is placed on training in planning, implementing, analysing and reporting your own work. All this, gives you important knowledge for your coming working life.

## About

During the Examination course, you do an independent work under the guidance of an appointed supervisor. During the course, you get both general guidance together with your classmates during seminars lead by the course leader(s) and individual supervision relating to your own work by your supervisor. You present your thesis, both as a written report and orally at a seminar. The examination is based on participation in the seminar series, the report and the final seminar.

You carry out the work in the project at a department at the Faculty of Science within the subject area or externally at another university, company, institute, organisation or authority.

You exercise your ability to make scientific assessments with regard to relevant scientific, social and ethical aspects. You will also receive training in comprehensively analyzing and interpreting complex problems and issues.

The degree course gives you the opportunity to show your ability to independently perform a project and to present and defend the results for classmates and teachers both in writing and orally.

The final report from the work can be written either in Swedish or English, with a summary in both languages according to the instructions given. However all seminars and oral presentations are given in English (unless all participants are fluid in the Swedish language).

The teaching consists of individual supervision and common seminar series.
