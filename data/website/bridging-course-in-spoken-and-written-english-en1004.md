## Summary

Preparatory course on elementary level covering English grammar, reading and listening comprehension.

This course gives access educational credits ('förutbildningspoäng'/'fup'), and not higher education credits ('högskolepoäng').

## About

The course is aimed at students who wish to achieve language proficiency in English equivalent to IELTS 6.5 and TOEFL 90. The course does not give formal qualifications of the Swedish upper secondary course English 6. The course contains a systematic account of English grammar with continuous exercises in the form of written assignments and provides training in reading and listening comprehension. The students practice summarising orally and in writing, and discussing texts that are complex with regard to content and language in order to prepare for continued university studies in English. Strong emphasis is placed on developing a critical approach to the material studied.

Once you have completed the course, you are qualified _only_ for English introductory level courses given at the Department of Languages and Literatures at University of Gothenburg (provided you meet other upper secondary level entry requirements). **This course gives access educational credits** ('förutbildningspoäng'/'fup'), and not higher education credits ('högskolepoäng').

The course cannot be included in a degree at university level.

The course has scheduled online classes.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements apply with the exception of Swedish and English. The requirement for the subject of English is a completed IELTS Academic test with the result 5.5 (no result on any part must be below 5.0) or the TOEFL iBT test with the result 72 (the result on the written component must be at least 17) or English 5 in the Swedish educational system, or the equivalent.

### Selection

Selection is based upon average grade from upper secondary school (34 %), the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits (33 %) and Högskoleprovet - Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (33 %).
