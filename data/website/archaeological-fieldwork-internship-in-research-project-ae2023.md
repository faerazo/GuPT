## About

The course focuses on practical training in archaeological field methodology and is conducted as part of the research project _Understanding Urban Identities_ (UUI). The course initially consists of an introductory lecture that deals with various scientific aspects of the current research project and the object of investigation. The student then participates in an archaeological excavation at the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci in Italy, which is conducted in the framework of the ongoing UUI research project. The course provides practical and theoretical knowledge in the planning, organization and execution of an archaeological survey in relation to a research task. Preliminary dates for the fieldwork are June 9-22 (travel days are included). An examination task will be added after the completed fieldwork. Those admitted to the course receive travel and free accommodation.
