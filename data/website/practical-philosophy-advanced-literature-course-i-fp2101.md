## About

The course consists of an in-depth and critical examination of literature central to one or more key areas of practical philosophy. The course can be divided into two parts examining two different areas (each comprising 7,5 hp) or one part examining one area (15 hp). In connection to the first meeting, a supervisor is assigned based on the student’s choice of area(s). The choice of area(s) and literature is made in consultation with the supervisor and examiner. In order for the course to fit the student’s future plans and other studies, the student will, as a rule, have the opportunity to influence the design of the content of the course and, in some cases, the examination. This is done in consultation with the supervisor and examiner.

## Prerequisites and selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
