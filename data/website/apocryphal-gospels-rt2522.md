## About

The course covers different types of apocryphal Gospels and introduce their contents. Historical-critical study of the texts is emphasized, as is the evaluation of their historical and theological significance. During the course, apocryphal Gospels are studied in translation. Special attention is given to the most well-known and debated among these texts, such as the Gospel of Thomas, the seemingly Judaism-oriented Gospels of the Ebionites, Nazoreans and Hebrews, and the so-called Infancy Gospels of James and Thomas. In addition to the primary texts, students familiarise themselves with the scholarly field and the academic discussion about these texts.

## Prerequisites and selection

Furthermore, a knowledge of languages equivalent to English A/English 5.
