## About

Tangible interaction is based on physical interfaces that are either specifically developed for one system or for those that in new ways, allows interaction with computer systems.

The course puts the skills and knowledge acquired in the prototyping course into an applied context. Tangible interaction deals with computational technology and services and offers both theoretical and practical educational modalities. Lectures will present theory and development of tangible interaction and draws from research and commercial practice. Technologies such as sensors, actuators and smart materials are presented from a perspective of human interaction and use.
