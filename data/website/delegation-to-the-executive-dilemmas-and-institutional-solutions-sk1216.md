## About

The course describes the basic problems that comes with delegating the power to the executive power. Its starting point is in the so-called principal agent theory but also raises criticism to this approach. More specifically, the course wants to answer questions such as: What problems domes with delegation? In principle,what are the solutions? What can never be solved?

Particularly noted in the course, is the various ways in which power can be handed over to executives, as well as the consequences this will have for cooperation, efficiency and policy by studying institutions for power transfer in different countries. Both more rationalistic perspectives and more institutional and historical perspectives are used to understand how it looks in different countries as well as within supranational bodies such as the EU.

The primary aim of the course is to teach both rationalistic and institutional perspectives, compare them and apply the different theoretical perspectives to understand the causes and consequences of different ways of organizing delegation to the executive power.
