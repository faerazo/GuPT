## About

This course explores some of the linguistic characteristics of spoken and written academic English. The course takes a hands-on approach, i.e. you will be encouraged to interact with real texts (your own and others’) through analyses and discussions. The course is based on research in second-language learning and will prepare you for further study in English, in particular in other areas where English is used for teaching and examination.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entrance requirements

### Assessment of qualifications

If you lack the formal qualifications in English, but believe that you have the equivalent knowledge of English, you may take a test to determine whether you are eligible. Read more:

[Diagnostic assessment of prior learning](https://www.gu.se/en/languages/diagnostic-assessment-of-prior-learning)

**NB:** It is not possible to take the test if you make a late application for the course.

### Selection

Selection is based upon average grade from upper secondary school (34 %), the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits (33 %) and Högskoleprovet - Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (33 %).

## After graduation
