## About

This course in optimization primarily treats large-scale, difficult, and often combinatorial optimization problems. You will study different methods of tackling such problems, through a lecture series and working on projects in a group. You will also touch on current research topics such as optimality conditions for non-convex optimization, column generation, and Lagrange duality. The course will conclude with an algorithm contest, where you compete by choosing the best and/or quickest approach to solving a problem!

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The prerequisite for the course Large-Scale Optimization is the equivalent of the course MMG621 Nonlinear Optimization or equivalent of the course MMG631 Linear and Integer Optimization with Applications.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
