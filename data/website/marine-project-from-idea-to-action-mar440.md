## About

The course is focused on the planning, execution, and dissemination of a marine project such as a monitoring program, or an assigned investigation at a company or public authority. You will receive training in key processes throughout a marine project, including budget, sampling design (statistical approach), variables to be measured (cost vs benefit analysis), and communication with stakeholders (written report and an oral presentation).

The course comprises seminars, workshops, lectures, group and stakeholder meetings. In addition, you will get training in group dynamic processes and how to act as a responsible group member. Most of the work is group based with 2-4 group members in each group.

Problem based learning (PBL) is used to make the teaching realistic and transferable to future challenges. Each group will be assigned a mentor for support and guidance throughout the PBL group assignments.

### Scientific cruise

During the course you will also meet potential stakeholders with long-term experience of marine projects. In the second part of the course you will get hands on experience executing a marine project. This involves a scientific cruise onboard the research vessel Skagerak to monitor an anoxic fjord. This part of the project includes sampling, analyses, interpretation of results, and dissemination of results.
