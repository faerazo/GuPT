## About

The course will present classical mathematical topics from a computing science perspective: giving specifications of the concepts introduced, paying attention to syntax and types, and ultimately constructing DSLs of some mathematical areas mentioned below.

The lecture topics are:

- Introduction to functional programming and calculational proofs

- Introduction to Domain Specific Languages (DSLs): case study linear algebra

- DSLs and mathematics: case study category theory

- Real analysis: mean value theorems, Taylor formulas
- Real analysis: a DSL for power series

- More linear algebra: eigenvalues and optimization

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The student should have successfully completed:

\- 7\\.5 hec in discrete mathematics, for example DIT980 Introductory Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists

\- 15 hec in mathematics, for example MMGD20 Linear Algebra D and MMGD30 Calculus D

\- 15 hec in computer science, for example DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming or MVG300 Programming with Matlab and DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-orientation

Additional 22.5 hec of any mathematics or computer science courses.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
