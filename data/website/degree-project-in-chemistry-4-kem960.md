## About

In the course Degree Project in Chemistry 4, you will do an independent project work to get your degree. The degree project in chemistry will give you experience of scientific work, analysis and reporting of scientific results. The project work usually contains both theoretical and experimental elements, but it can also be a completely theoretical work. You will perform the project work at the end of your master's programme.

You will normally perform your project work in one of the research groups at the department. In that case, your work will be part of an ongoing research project. You can also do your degree project in a company or an authority. Regardless of where you do your project work, you will work under your own responsibility with the support of a knowledgeable supervisor.

It is your responsibility as a student to find a suitable project and contact the supervisor and the examiner for the independent work. If necessary, the student counsellor can help you. In your contacts with your supervisor and examiner, you should be able to show that you have completed the advanced courses within the subject area that are required for this course.

The choice of assignment you are going to work with and time for the start of the course will be decided in consultation with the subject's examiner and supervisor. Literature is chosen together with the supervisor. At the end of the course, you will summarize your work in the form of a written scientific report and present it at a seminar.

Beside this 60 credits course, there are other degree project courses:

- Degree Project in Chemistry 2 (KEM930), 30 credits
- Degree Project in Chemistry 3 (KEM945), 45 credits.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection
