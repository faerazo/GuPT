## About

Introduces how environmental problems are analysed in economics. The first part focuses on the role of the state in environmental regulation. How should society make decisions and how can the benefits resulting from environmental improvements be measured.

The second part of the course focuses on environmental economic instruments. An overview of different types of regulations is given and the characteristics of different instruments are discussed in more detail. The effect of imperfect markets such as the impact of lack of information on the choice of policy instruments is also discussed. Several examples of instruments used in practice are given during the course.

NEK304 is given in the second quartile and can be taken as an elective course in the Bachelor's programme together with Basic Econometrics NEK301 and Essay NEK316.
