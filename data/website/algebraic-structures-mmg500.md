## About

The course introduces the most important structures in abstract algebra.

The ones which are common to all algebraic structures are emphasized, such as homomorphisms, isomorphisms and quotient objects. Group theory, which has many applications in physics and chemistry, takes up more than half the course. For example, groups are used to classify elementary particles and to study the symmetries of crystals. Group theory is also used in most forms of geometry. The rest of the course is about ring theory; as important examples of rings we study fields and polynomial rings over fields.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to 60 credits in mathematics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
