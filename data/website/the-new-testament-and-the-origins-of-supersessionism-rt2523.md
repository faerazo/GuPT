## About

In the course, selected texts from the New Testament and Apostolic Fathers, primarily parts of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Epistle of Barnabas, are studied in their original language and in critical editions. In addition, the student will study the origins of so-called supersessionist theology, a complex of ideas claiming that emergent Christianity has in one way or another replaced Judaism as the expression of the covenant between God and humanity. The student will delve into the question of how the authors of the texts employ typological and allegorical models for interpreting Old Testament texts in a supersessionist direction. Special emphasis will be placed on critical evaluation of so-called post-supersessionist readings of the New Testament and on the impact of supersessionist thought on Jewish-Christian relations.

## Prerequisites and selection
