## About

This course module deals with the doctrine of the Holy Spirit -

pneumatology - as it has been historically developed in the Christian

church and in contemporary theological reflection, as well as with the

related theology of the Church, known as ecclesiology. These

doctrines have been heavily debated throughout history, not just among

theologians, but also among philosophers. They have also frequently been

related to political questions. In the contemporary global Christian

landscape the doctrine of the Spirit, in particular, has come under new

theological scrutiny as a result of the growing pentecostal-charismatic

constituency. Through close engagement with significant theological

texts, this course aims at a deeper understanding of these doctrines in

their context, enabling students to pursue further theological

reflection on Spirit and community with a confident handling of sources

and a firm grasp of the central issues.
