## Summary

This course focuses on the relationship between democracy and the EU by tracking the developments of the institutional structures within the union, the interactions between political parties and European politics, and the public opinion and voting behavior of European citizens at the EU level.

## About

Over the last two decades, European integration has become increasingly politicized. Where public opinion on the European Union (EU) was once marked by its permissive consensus, the attitudes of EU citizens now often appear as a constraining dissensus on integration. Despite changes within the institutions of the EU, designed to enhance its representative legitimacy, and shifts in the way political parties interact with the EU, the organization still encounters criticisms of a ‘democratic deficit’. This course focuses on Institutions, processes, practices, and actors of the European Union.

You will learn about historical, cultural, social, and economic differences between and within EU member states that can have influence on European integration and democracy. The course also gives you deeper knowledge about the interactions between political parties, European politics, and the public opinion and voting behavior of European citizens.

During this course you will work independently and group-wise to analyze empirical information with the help of basic concepts regarding integration, political legitimacy, democratic representation, and political mobilization.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

## After graduation

After finishing this course, you will have deeper knowledge about the relationship between democracy and the EU.
