## About

**Recent years have seen drastic developments in terms of digitalisation in sports. The use of digital technology in sports affects how sports teams are organized and managed, how we gain access to sports information and design new sports equipment. Digitization has also created new sports, such as e-Sports, which have major consequences for the perception of what sports are and how sports are practiced. The development of analytical technology to support performance improvement has also been intensified with the help of digitalisation.**

This course gives you the opportunity to acquire and apply knowledge about digitalisation in sports as a general societal phenomenon as well as professionalized specialized activities. After the course, you will have the ability to analyze, evaluate and explain how digitalisation affects and develops different sports.

### Online education

The course is given entirely online. You will have the possibility to participate in the course in a way that suits you. You can either follow the course synchronously, with lectures and seminars online, or take part in the content asynchronously, when you have time. It is also possible to adapt the course pace to your own circumstances. In this way, it is possible to complete the course alongside other activities, such as work or other studies.

### Multiple perspectives

You will gain insights into how digital technologies have influenced endurance sports such as running, cycling and cross-country skiing, as well as team sports such as football and ice hockey. We will also focus on emerging technologies and platforms.

The perspectives that will be treated, the literature as well as guest lecturers in the course are chosen based on an effort to offer a breadth of approaches that are inclusive and equal.
