## About

The course covers the principles of programming language-based techniques for computer security.

The goal is;

1) Understanding such applicaiton-level attacks as race conditions, buffer overruns, covert channels, and code injection.

2)

The dual perspective of attack vs. protection is threaded through the lectures, laboratory assignments, and projects.
