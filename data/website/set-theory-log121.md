## About

The course treats Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ZFC, formulated in first-order logic, beginning with a set theoretical construction of the natural and real number systems. Ordinal and cardinal numbers are presented and strong emphasis is placed on the cumulative hierarchy and on the role of the axiom of choice in the axiomatization of the concept of set.

The course is given by the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science. [Link to the webpage.](https://www.gu.se/en/flov)
