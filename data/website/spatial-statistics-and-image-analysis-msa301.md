## About

The course provides you with an introduction to spatial statistics and statistical image analysis. In the first part, statistical models for images (stochastic fields and point processes), methods for filtering and reconstruction, and simulation methods for stochastic inference are introduced. The second part of the course focuses on methods from statistics and machine learning for pattern recognition and classification. During the course, we look at applications in areas such as climate, remote sensing, microscopy, photography and medical imaging.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge corresponding to thecourses MSG110 Probability Theory and MSG800 Basic Stochastic Processes.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
