## Summary

This course is a direct continuation of the introductory course in Somali and focuses on developing your reading and translation skills, conversation and knowledge of linguistic terminology.

## About

In this course, your reading skills in Somali are developed through the study of adapted and commented texts that are provided with glossaries and sound recordings. An additional vocabulary of about 500 words and phrases is introduced. You practice simple conversation through the study and practical application of frequent constructions and everyday phrases. Your translation skills are developed further, mainly from Somali, but also into Somali. The course introduces an increased linguistic terminology together with information about Somali phonetics, grammar and semantics. In the course, the sociolinguistic situation is further discussed.

The course has scheduled online classes.
