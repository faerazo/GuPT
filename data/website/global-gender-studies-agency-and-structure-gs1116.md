## Summary

In this course you learn to use theories of agency and structure in order to understand structural inequalities and how these may change. Apply for courses in global gender studies if you aim to specialize in challenges related to gender issues.

## About

Discussions about women and men as actors or victims of structures are constantly recurring. How to handle this question is a crucial challenge for feminist theory in our time. In this course you will learn to use theories of agency and structure in order to understand structural inequalities and how these may change. We challenge our understanding of gender and its framework, while studying a number of current global themes such as migration, nations, states and borders, conflicts, religion and security, trade and labor, and health and sexuality.

The teaching in Global Gender Studies takes the form of lectures and seminars. In the seminars you will get the opportunity to deepen your understanding and let your views be confronted with the perspectives of other students. A fundamental part of the courses' design is continuous writing assignments, which give you an opportunity to develop your own thinking and writing. The courses are held in English with both Swedish and international students.
