## About

The purpose of this course is to provide a basic knowledge of the physics behind modern imaging and microanalytical techniques based on the interaction of a probe of energetic electrons or ions with matter, and to develop an understanding of how different signals generated in these processes may be interpreted in terms of a materials structure at the atomic, nano and micro scales.

The course will also give some practical experience of up-to-date instrumentation utilizing the techniques in imaging and microanalysis that are discussed. The techniques discussed in the course are powerful tools that are widely used in materials research and development in both industry and academia.

The course provides a basis for specialised courses in, for example, experimental physics, materials physics and nanoscience.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelors degree in physics or equivalent.Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
