## About

This course is intended for students at the advanced level (Magister and Master), as well as for those doing Doctoral research. You should preferably be in the writing phase of your project, although it is also possible to take the course before you reach that stage.

The course explores relevant issues of academic writing in English with a focus on writing dissertations (Magister, Master, PhD). The course explores a range of genres and subgenres (e.g. titles, abstracts, introductions, discussions) across a wide range of disciplines. While the course is offered at the Faculty of Arts, participants from other disciplines will benefit from the course, too. The course takes a hands-on approach, i.e. course participants will be encouraged to interact with real texts (theirs and others) through analyses and discussions; in addition, the course will offer opportunities to practise the contents discussed in class.

Please note this is not a language proficiency course, but proceeds from the assumption that the participants have a good command of English.

### Diagnostic assessment of prior learning

Please contact the Study advisor for English via email to: [studievagledning.engelska@sprak.gu.se](mailto:studievagledning.engelska@sprak.gu.se) at the time of applying for the course.
