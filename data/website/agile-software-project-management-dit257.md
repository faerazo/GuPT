## About

The course provides a practical introduction to Software Engineering.

Students work on an open problem that is defined by stakeholders outside of the students' team. This means that students will not be able to define the project they work on themselves. By iteratively planning and evaluating their work, they organise themselves in order to reach a joint goal with limited resources. To do this, they apply an agile software development process to structure their work. They specify and evaluate requirements and the collaboration with stakeholders to assure that what is being delivered is perceived as valuable. Students reflect on their own work and learning every week to enable a continuous improvement of their way of working. At the same time, they acquire skills and knowledge in new technologies, tools, and fitting ways to use them in order to provide value to a stakeholder based on the students' own learning strategies.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course, the student must have completed courses in programming for at least 15 HEC, e.g., two of DIT440, DIT012, or DIT953.

### Selection

Selection is based upon average grade from upper secondary school (34 %), the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits (33 %) and Högskoleprovet - Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test (33 %).
