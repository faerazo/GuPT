## About

In this course you will learn about the global energy system and how our human needs for energy affect the Earth and environment. You will review some fundamental ideas related to how we form and transform energy and apply these in the context of modern energy systems.  You will investigate the consequences of human energy production and the implications for global climate and sustainability. This includes the balance of energy and how different energy resources and utilizations contribute to the global picture.

This course is aimed at you if you are interested in the how humans create, transform, and use energy and the global consequences of our energy appetites.

The course is given as a series of lectures, problem solving sessions and a literature review project that includes written and presentation components. The course is designed to provide you with a solid background for carrying out independent project work and for finding work within the field or for pursuing further high-level studies.
