The purpose of the course is to find out about the basic interactive dimension of language use and structure and the specific conditions that apply when studying dialogue compared to those that apply in traditional linguistics.

Participants in the course will become familiar with a number of different ways of approaching scientific problems within dialogue research and with the possibilities and limitations of each method. The course will cover both human-human and human-machine interaction, as well as, language acquisition, animal communication, and the issues that arise as a result of current language technology developments.
