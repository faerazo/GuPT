## About

The aim of the course is to study and conduct an analysis of an economic problem based on economic theory and scientific method. Here you have the opportunity to specialize through your choice of subject.

The thesis will be presented and defended at a seminar. You will also have to oppose another thesis and actively participate in seminars.

The essay can be written in English or Swedish and the opposition can be in both languages. As a rule, the thesis is written together with another student.

NEK316 is a compulsory course for a Bachelor's degree in Economics and is taken at the advanced level in Economics together with NEK301, as well as one of three elective courses.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.
