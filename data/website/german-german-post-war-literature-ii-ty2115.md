## About

The course treats German post-war literature based on texts that have influenced both the public debate and the writing of German literary history. The public debate has revolved around issues concerning the relation between e.g. Auschwitz and post-warliterature, debt and innocence, the division of Germany and the reunion, and conservatism and avantgarde.

You will have the opportunity to deepen your knowledge of how certain themes mark and function as transitions in German post-war literature and develop your ability to analyze and reason critically.
