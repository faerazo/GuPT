## Summary

This is a practical course, where you learn how the EU works in practice by focusing on a real case of your own choice. You will learn how to search for original documents from the EU institutions, how to trace the legislative process from the earliest mentioning to final law, and the transposition into member state legislation. You will also train how to write a professional report and do an oral presentation.

## About

This course is developed as a unique cooperation between the Centre for European Studies and the European Documentation Centre (EDC), at the University Library at the University of Gothenburg. In this practically oriented course, you will learn how to find and use official documents from the EU and how the EU decision-making process works in practice. You will also train how to write a professional report suitable for working-life and to give a professional oral presentation with visual aid.

The course consists of three interlinked modules: EU institutions and decision-making procedures, Official documents and information of the EU, and Report and oral presentation. During this course you will learn about EU institutions and how EU documentation is organised by practical exercises in searching for information in various data bases. You will conduct an independent search for information (regarding an EU directive of your choice), by following the different steps of the EU decision-making process and the transposition to national law.

In this course, you will also learn how to create a scientific report, from initial idea to a final written report, in accordance to high academic standards, including correct referencing techniques and proper language. Another important part of this part of the course is source criticism and discussions regarding the availability and transparency of EU documentation.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The requirement for admission is a minimum of 60 credits or equivalent knowledge. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

After the course you have basic knowledge about the EU, particularly about the EU institutions and decision-making procedures. You will know how to find different forms of EU information, with a particular focus on the various official EU documents and in which databases they can be found. You will have acquired knowledge on how to write a professional report and do an oral presentation using visual aid. You will have developed your international competence and increased your employability for the future.
