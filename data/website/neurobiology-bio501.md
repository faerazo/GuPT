## About

The course Neurobiology will explore the structure and function of the mammalian nervous system by examining the molecules, cells, and circuits that are involved in directing behavior.

You will learn

- how the nervous system is built during development
- how it changes with experience throughout life
- how it functions in normal behaviour
- how malfunctioning communication between neurons and other cells leads to neurological diseases.

The course will also cover basic and functional anatomy of the central nervous system.

### Teaching

Teaching methods include lectures and highly interactive seminars. Through group assignments and individual assignments, you will learn and practice how to understand scientific literature in the field of neurobiology and how to present and discuss questions concerning neurobiology in a broader perspective.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

In addition, applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course is an advanced course in biology and can be included in the following programmes:

- Master's programme in Neurobiochemistry
- Master's programme in Molecular Biology
- Master's programme in Biology
- Master's programme in Genomics and Systems Biology.

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.
