## Summary

The biodiversity provides humans with a range of resources and ecosystem services. At the international level, there are several conventions, regulations and other initiatives to protect biodiversity. Also, the development of red lists of threatened species forms part of this work. If you wish to learn more about the international collaboration to protect biodiversity, this is the course for you. The skills that you acquire are useful for anyone working with protection of biological diversity.

## About

In this course, you will gain insight into a number of international conventions relating to the conservation of biodiversity and biodiversity resources. This includes e.g. the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade with Endangered Species (CITES), the Ramsar Wetland Convention as well as the World heritage Convention. We also discuss the EU directives dealing with nature conservation and biodiversity protection and how they are implemented.

You will learn about Red-listing classification system and its scientific background. We also discuss how biodiversity can be preserved in situ and ex situ, and the roles gene banks and museum collections play.

In an individual project, we focus on species or areas that are highlighted by an international convention or the red lists. For a species or area of your choice, you describe the biological background, the specific conditions that led to its status as endangered, and the protection that the species is given by international laws and agreements.

**Teaching** The course is internet-based. You will get access to a course guide, recorded lectures and some literature via Canvas, the university’s learning platform. There is also a discussion forum on Canvas for interaction with the teachers.
