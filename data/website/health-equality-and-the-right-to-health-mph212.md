## Summary

With the aspiration to narrow the gap in health disparities, simplistic solutions are frequently attempted but often fall short. The primary objective of this course is to cultivate a heightened awareness of the complexity underlying the emergence and persistence of health inequalities.

It also aims to provide you with a fundamental comprehension of how the lens of human rights and the right to health contribute understanding of and action on health inequalities.

## About

The course gives a more critical and deeper understanding of how different concepts, theories, and frameworks add to our understanding of health inequalities but also affect our view on potential action to handle these ineuqalities.

Within the field of public health, concepts such as vulnerability, power, health, behavior, politics, gender and commercial actors are fequently used. However, definitions often vary, raising the question: what do these concepts truly mean, and what roles do the play in shaping health outcomes?

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Qualification for admission to the course requires professional degree/Bachelor's degree of at least 180 credits in a health science, social science, science, economics, arts or engineering field of education and grade Passed/E in English B/English 6

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
