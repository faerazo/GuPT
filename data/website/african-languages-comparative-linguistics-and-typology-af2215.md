## Summary

You gain knowledge about and understanding of basic theories and methods in the research domains of comparative linguistics and language typology and learn to give an account of relationships between language and important characterising features of various language families in Africa.

## About

The course focuses on systematically comparative language studies of African languages. You study recurrent patterns in different language systems as well as hypotheses concerning unit, diversity, possibilities and limitations in human language. The focus is on languages in Africa and their phonology, morphology and syntax and information structure. Throughout the course, theories of the relationship of the languages from a synchronic and a diachronic perspective are also treated.

In an independent task, you identify a relevant question in order to analyse data by means of current theories and methods. The independent task should focus on a specific language typological issue question from an African perspective.

**The course has scheduled online classes primarily daytime.**
