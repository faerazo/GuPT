## Summary

Reading texts is intended to strengthen your general skills in the French language and broaden your general knowledge of French culture. As part of the course, you read roughly 1000 pages of text in French. You should preferably choose linguistics and/or literary texts, but subject to an agreement with the examiner, you may be able to include some fiction from the French-speaking world if this is motivated by the focus of your independent project. If you do include some fiction, the total number of pages required rises to about 1250.

## About

The course is taught in English and/or French.

## Prerequisites and selection
