## About

There is only one Earth. With global challenges such as climate change, mass extinction of species, rising inequity and a growing world population, the prospects for a quality life for all, seem rather bleak.

A central question in this course is the question: What is the role and responsibility of education in not only responding to sustainability problems but also in preventing them and in creating more sustainable futures?

In this 15-credit master’s course you will critically and actively explore central concepts and perspectives in the field of Education for Sustainable Development. The course content will be related to the participants’ own backgrounds, specific interests and prior experiences.

Students with various study backgrounds (e.g. environmental sciences, social sciences, educational sciences, economics, arts and humanities) can enroll in this course as long as you have an interest in both sustainable development and education.

The course is an introduction to and a grounding for other courses within the Master's Programme in Education for Sustainable Development.
