## About

In this course you will learn to do the impossible: to differentiate non-differentiable functions. We do this by introducing distributions, which is a larger class of objects than functions. All bounded functions are included in the class of distributions, all distributions are differentiable and conform to the ordinary rules of differentiation, and for differentiable functions the distribution derivative is the same as the ordinary derivative. Distributions also give us a way to generalize the Fourier transform. Distribution theory is of fundamental importance in modern analysis, especially in the theory of differential equations.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to the course MMA110 Integration Theory.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
