## About

The course Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics is aimed for you who wants to gain knowledge about modern scientific methodology, and how this information can be used to generate

new knowledge in fundamental biology, disease understanding and

ecology.

Bioinformatics and functional genomics are areas of biology that handle the explosion of data created by new large-scale methods for measuring life's molecules. The DNA sequence information for a large number of organisms' genomes is known today, and there is a continued exponential growth of DNA/RNA/protein sequences. Most of the sequenced organisms are bacteria, but also many single and multicellular eukaryotic organisms are represented, including humans. This new information has led to major changes in scientific thinking. Among other things, it is found that for many of the genes now identified, the function is unknown.

The course Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics highlights this new challenge with an interdisciplinary perspective, with an emphasis on experimental methodology. Many of the elements of the course integrate bioinformatic analysis of sequences with experimental functional genomics data that includes all transcripts, all proteins and all metabolites in cells.

### Teaching

The teaching is based on traditional lectures that are interspersed with work in smaller groups. Several of the assignments during the course are clearly problem-based and result in written reports and oral presentations. This gives you a deeper knowledge and you become better at analyzing and thinking scientifically about how new knowledge is generated, and how it is best presented.

You have close contact with dedicated teachers who research in the field, and also with international teachers.

The course is geared towards computer-based studies, and you gain good skills in various relevant computer programmes and international databases, both in sequence analysis and the analysis of other types of high-throughput-data.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Completed basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology and biodiversity and systematics, or equivalent, of which at least 45 credits must be approved.

Alternatively;

Passed courses within the first and second year of the Bachelor program in Marine Science. At least 90 of the 120 credits must be passed.

In addition English proficiency is required to the level of English 6/English Course B from Swedish Upper Secondary School, or be certified by an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

This is a course in biology at the Bachelor's level. The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor's programme in Molecular Biology
- Bachelor's programme in Biology
- Master's programme in Molecular Biology
- Master's programme in Biology
- Master's programme in Genomics and Systems Biology.

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

The course provides a good background for further master's studies, especially within the programme in Genomics and Systems Biology. The course is also of great value for other fields.

The course is suitable for students who want to pursue a research career, work in the pharmaceutical industry or within government agencies with future challenges that include new types of data for monitoring and risk analysis.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
