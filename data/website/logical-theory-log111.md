## About

The course provides a solid foundation in the theory formation of logic through a comprehensive presentation of syntax, semantics and proof systems for propositional logic and classical first-order predicate logic. As examples of other logics, second-order and intuitionistic logic are presented together with completeness results. Basic proof theory is introduced and lead up to a proof of normalisation for natural deduction. Gödel's incompleteness theorems and basic recursion theory are also included. The course does not require mathematical skills, but it is an advantage if you have the habit of reading mathematical text.

The course is given by the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science. [Link to the webpage.](https://www.gu.se/en/flov)
