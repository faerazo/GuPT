## Summary

The theme for Autumn 2024 is ‘Millennial Fiction’, a hypothetical category supposedly defined by themes of digital malaise, ecological anxiety, globalisation, a reducing likelihood of economic and material security, and romantic apathy. We ask whether there really is such a phenomenon, considering a diverse selection of novels and short fiction from Great Britain, Ireland and North America in light not only of such themes but also their implications for fictional style and narration.

## About

You train your abiltity to describe and analyse literary concepts, phenomena and theories that are included in the theme of the course.

You learn to apply literary theory and method in the analysis of literary texts and in your own production on the basis of the theme of the course. You also practise communicating in an idiomatic, grammatically and academically  correct way in speech and in writing in English.

The course has scheduled online classes.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be admissible to the course, students must have completed the English literature module, 7.5 credits, in the Introductory course in English, 30 credits or the equivalent thereof.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation
