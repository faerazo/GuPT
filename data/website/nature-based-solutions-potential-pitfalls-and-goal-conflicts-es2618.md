## Summary

Have you heard of nature-based solutions? Are you curious about how we can deal with various societal problems and at the same time improve our own and the ecosystem's viability? Then you've come to the right place!

This course is aimed at those who are interested in, and want to contribute to, future solutions to cope with the transition to a more sustainable society in terms of climate change, biodiversity and our well-being.

## About

The concept of nature-based solutions includes measures based on nature's ability to solve societal challenges in connection with e.g., extreme weather, climate change, erosion etc. A properly designed nature-based solution benefits several areas at the same time: biodiversity, mitigation of climate change or its effects, and human well-being.

In this course you will gain knowledge about how to define a nature-based solution, what pitfalls and goal conflicts that may exist and how to use nature-based solutions to deal with environmental and societal problems. The course will first provide a broad background on different types of nature-based solutions and then focus and provide deeper knowledge in a few different areas of use, such as forestry, urban environments and landscape management. You will also gain insight into how nature-based solutions are treated in an international perspective (e.g. IPCC, IPBES and the European Commission) and examples of how the concept is used at national and local level.

The first week of the course contains lectures to provide breadth and understanding. The weeks that follow will be more themed with focus areas such as forestry, urban environments and landscape management, where each week contains a study visit/excursion and a case study/group project.
