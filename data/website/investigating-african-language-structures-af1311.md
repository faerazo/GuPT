## Summary

In this course students are introduced to scientific research in African linguistics, both how to formulate research questions, how to do research and how to present and discuss research in writing.

## About

The aim of the course is to introduce students to scientific research in

African linguistics. Special attention is given to research questions,

research methods, and the structure of academic papers. Necessary

concepts are introduced through lectures and texts from basic handbooks.

The acquired knowledge is then applied in assignments where samples of

good BA essays and accessibly written scholarly articles are analysed

through critical reading and discussion. At the end of the course each

student presents their plan for an intended bachelor project. These

project plans are discussed in a final seminar.

**The course has scheduled online classes.**
