## About

In this course students will learn to in practice use economic theory and empirical methods to analyse different economic problems. This is primarily done by applying the material from previous courses at both the introductory and intermediate level. The idea is that one should get an insight into how economists actually work with both models and empirical methods to understand and analyse a complex reality.

The course contains both mico- and macro economic questions. The micro economic questions relate to how individual actors, such as individuals and firms, for example value different good or how they behave under different market conditions. Questions that could be discussed range from demand for local environmental quality, or what pricing strategy a firm should use. The macro economic questions concern how factor at an aggregate or societal level relate to each other. Examples of questions include what factor explain the economic growth for a country such as Sweden over a longer time period, or how does the relationship between unemployment inflation evolve over time.
