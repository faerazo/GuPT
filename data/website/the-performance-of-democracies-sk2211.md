## Summary

The course addresses questions about the ability of democratic states to generate desirable outcomes in various fields. The focus is on questions such as why and how democratic states succeed or fail in different areas. You also study consequences of the performance of democracy on citizens' attitudes and support for democracy.

The course is offered as an elective in-depth course within the Master's programme in Political Science, and as a single subject course.

## About

In this course you explore factors that explain cross country variation in democratic performance and their implications. More specifically, it is concerned with how institutional variation among democratic regimes is related to outcomes in general dimensions of performance, such as, human well-being, corruption and sound management of public finances, among others.

It therefore takes a quality of ‘governance’ perspective, focusing on why and how democracies ‘succeed or fail'. You also get to study the implications that follow for citizen attitudes and democratic support.
