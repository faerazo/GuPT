## Summary

The course provides knowledge about how climate models are constructed, you also learn about the climate system and the practical programming required for climate data analysis.

## About

Climate Modelling studies the physical and dynamic processes that affect and control the climate system as well as the mathematical and computational methods used to calculate them.

The students will learn basic climate system physical processes, programming in data analysis tools, current scientific understanding of global warming as well as important natural climate variations like El Niño.

The course will provide knowledge and understanding of how climate models are designed and used. After completing the course, students will be able to use climate models as well as analyze and visualize results from climate modeling experiments.

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- lectures
- computer-based exercises
- project work

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires basic knowledge of the climate system equivalent to GV1410 Geosciences, Basic Level Course 30 credits, GV0340 Earth System Sciences 7.5 credits, and GV2500 Data Analysis for Earth Sciences 7.5 credits and at least 180 credits in the main field of Earth Sciences, Environmental Science, Marine Sciences, Physics or Computer Science and Engineering. Students with equivalent educationmay, after review and approval, be admitted to the course.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you study Earth Science, you have good career opportunities both in Sweden and abroad. You can choose to work in industry, as a consultant, project manager or in public administration.

Our former students work, for example, with natural resource management, environmental issues and urban planning, you also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Exchange opportunities

If you are studying Earth Science at the University of Gothenburg, there are good opportunities for exchange studies during your studies. This is often seen as a good asset when applying for jobs, as many jobs require international collaboration. We have over 100 agreements within Erasmus and other exchange programs with universities around the world, both within and outside Europe.
