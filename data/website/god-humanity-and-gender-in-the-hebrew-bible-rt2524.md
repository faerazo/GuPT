## About

The course involves a study of selected text from the Hebrew Bible,

focusing on constructions of gender and attributes of gender to God and

man. Using various biblical methods, feminist exegesis and theology,

masculinity research, and queer theory, the student is provided tools

for a critical approach to different Jewish and Christian

interpretations of God and human, expressed in terms of sex and gender

in the Hebrew Bible. In addition to reading texts in the original

language of the Hebrew Bible, the study includes relevant extra-biblical

texts as well as secondary literature in the form of monographs and

comments.
