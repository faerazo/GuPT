## Summary

The course is an introduction to a conceptual and empirical inquiry on globalization. You are welcome to take the course to complement other studies, or to deepen your professional skills.

## About

This course introduces students to key concepts and theories within the study of globalization. Using an interdisciplinary perspective including human ecology, peace and development, and social anthropology, it familiarizes students with academic debates on and approaches to study global interconnectedness and topics of global concern.
