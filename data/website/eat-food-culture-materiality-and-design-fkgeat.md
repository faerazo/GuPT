## Summary

This course is for those who are interested in the connection between design and eating. Through fundamental design methods, we work with concepts and phenomena in food culture and design to create common knowledge and understanding. We do this through workshops, literature, field trips, supervision and discussions, both individually and collectively in group meetings as well as through individual project work.

## About

Eating can involve an infinite number of different things. It can be about survival, pleasure or stress as well as meetings, time and access. Eating has different meanings for everyone.

The course is aimed at you who is interested in the relations between design and eating. Perhaps you involved in the restaurant business, work with design or have an interest for food culture. Through basic design methods the students of the course will work with concepts of design and food culture to create collective knowledge and understanding. Together you will explore the meal as a platform for conversation, reflection, experiences and meetings. The materiality, spatiality and choreography of eating – that is, the things we use, the space we are in and how we move about – is the hub of your exploratory design work.

During the semester you will engage in a design project that has its entry point in one of the three themes of the course: Food – Body (such as the senses and norms), Food – Politics (such as power and resource allocation) and Food – Artefacts (such as function and materials)

[At our website](https://eathdk.se) you can learn about workshops, student work and course related events from previous semesters.

The course is taught in English.

**Course sessions**

The course meetings are planned to primarily take place on Mondays and Tuesdays starting from week 37. Initially, the course meetings will be held every third week, which will then transition to meetings approximately every other week.

A more detailed schedule for the course will be published in Timeedit and Canvas in June 2024.
