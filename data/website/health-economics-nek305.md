## About

The main purpose of the course is to teach students to use the microeconomic toolbox of theory and methods to analyze and understand problems within health economics. This course presents students with general economic questions related to demand, supply and production of health and health services.

In particular the course will discuss the role of (asymmetric) information in health, health care and health insurance markets; finance and organization of health care and insurance; and the determinants of health and health behavior.

The course will also discuss distributional and inequality issues. Students will practice critical assessment of both theory and empirical methods. The course presents the basic models of economic evaluations of health care programmes and interventions, providing students with basic practical tools and understanding of the pros and cons of these models.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.
