## About

Applies economic knowledge to key economic and social problems. Part of the course focuses on using survey methods to measure individuals' preferences. You will learn how to use the method and how to analyse the results of a survey econometrically. A variety of applications in environmental and health economics are reviewed. It also illustrates how the results can be used in a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA).

The second part of the course focuses on the methodological difficulties that can arise when using survey and register data to evaluate different policies and measures. The main focus is on the "randomized experiments" and "differences-in-differences" methods for policy evaluation. For each method, necessary assumptions and data conditions are discussed. A variety of applications in labour market, education and health economics are presented.

NEK307 is given in the second quartile and can be taken as an elective course in the Bachelor's programme together with Basic Econometrics, NEK301 and Essay NEK316.
