## About

This course provides an introduction to our own solar system and planets orbiting other stars - exoplanets. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in recent decades following the development of groundbreaking instruments and facilities, particularly after the launch of several dedicated space telescopes. One of the greatest discoveries is the exceptional diversity of exoplanets where several new types of planets without equivalents in our own solar system have been discovered.

The aim is to make students familiar with this new research field and gain an understanding of our own planet and planetary system in this context.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
