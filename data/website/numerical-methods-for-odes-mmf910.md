# Numerical methods for ODEs

Course


MMF910


Master’s level



7.5 credits (ECTS)



Offered by the
[Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.gu.se/en/mathematical-sciences)
at
[Faculty of Science and Technology](https://www.gu.se/en/science-and-technology)

## About

In the course, you will learn about numerical methods for ODEs, such as Runge-Kutta methods and their linear stability analysis. You will also learn to implement and use various numerical methods for ODEs and geometric integrators.

Depending on the participants’ interests, more specialized topics will be covered, such as numerical methods for stiff problems, geometric numerical methods, Lie group integrators, or geometric mechanics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For entrance to the course, knowledge corresponding to the coursesLinear algebra MMG400and multivariable calculus MMG300, and good working knowledge of a programming language is required.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
