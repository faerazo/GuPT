## About

The patristic period is the most formative period of Christian theology.

Studying it is to place oneself in a privileged position from which to

understand the emergence of a whole tradition of thought, with its basic

motives, problems, and solutions. This is the period in which the early

church, with its Biblical legacy, takes root in the world of ancient

Greece and Rome. Studying patristic theology, however, is more than a

historical exercise, for contemporary theology is very often

characterized by a retrieval of ancient sources, which is why a solid

grounding in the theology of the early church remains indispensable for

theological work at a higher level. This course focuses on the reading

of patristic primary sources and provides a well-rounded understanding

the theological situation of the early church.
