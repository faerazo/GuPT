## About

Generative syntax revolutionised linguistics in the 1960s, and today this is the most prolific and widespread type of syntactic analysis. In this introduction to the field, we start from basic assumptions and introduce theories and methodologies, step by step, through observation of syntactic data.

The course aims to provide the student with an understanding of the background to generative grammar, and a knowledge of terminology and analytical methods of the field. During the course, students will work with hands on generative analysis of language samples in English, or in the student’s language of choice. Participants will also learn how to formulate and test grammatical hypotheses within the framework of generative grammar.

In order to achieve an understanding of generative grammar in relationship to other grammatical theories and analytical models, the course also takes a comparative view on the field’s history of ideas.

The course language is English. Course papers can be written in English, Swedish, or other languages by agreement with the course coordinator.
