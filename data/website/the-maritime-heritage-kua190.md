## About

The course aims to give you knowledge of the various maritime activities in the 19th-20th centuries, and on how these activities can be understood in relation to the emergence of the industrial society. The focus is on the Nordic waters and includes both technical and economic processes and systems, and objects that can be terrestrial facilities – for example, ports and yards or vessels of various kinds. The course allows you to, through a conservation perspective, explore how the maritime cultural heritage is maintained and further developed.

In the course, you have the opportunity to do individual in-depth studies that may be aimed at problems concerning cultural-historical documentation of vessels, material-related problems and methods for care, maintenance and restoration. You can also choose to focus on recreational boats as individual objects or designers or as a social phenomenon with a bearing on the post-war increased emphasis on leisure life.

The course involves both literature studies, lectures, seminars, and study visits.

## Prerequisites and selection
