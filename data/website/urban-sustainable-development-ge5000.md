## Summary

The course explores, from a broad geographical perspective, how people's daily lives and living environments are affected by the process of urban transformation and what impact it has on the urban environment and the pursuit of sustainable development.

## About

The course adopts a broad geographical perspective on the process of urbanization. The course focuses partly on a deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of urban growth and its consequences, and partly on a description of the opportunities and challenges of todays and tomorrows urban landscapes are facing in achieving sustainable development.

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Geography, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- lectures
- project work
- excursions
- seminars and guest lectures

Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor of science (180 credits) within the main field of geography, human geography or physical geography. Students with comparable qualifications may, after evaluation, attend the course.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Geographers often work with urban planning, environmental management or broader issues related to sustainable development, in Sweden or internationally. As a geographer, you may work on planning new public transport, roads, water supply or urban planning for climate change. Geographers can be found in business, government and international organizations.

Our former students work, for example, as environmental consultants, coordinators, urban planners and GIS consultants. You also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.
