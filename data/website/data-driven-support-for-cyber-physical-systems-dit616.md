## About

The course gives an introduction to new cyber-physical systems, such as the smart grid, where data has become very important for adaptive operations and with an increased dependence on information and communication technologies (ICT). Topics in the course are focused on new methods in the intersection of computer science and other domains, to support distributed operations, cyber security, and processing of data that are generated due to digitalization of these systems (considering that the data can be massive).

The content is focused on distributed computing and systems, data processing, information and systems security, networking and computer communication in the context of new cyber-physical systems. There are lectures from the faculty to give an overview of the areas of the course, and invited presentations from industry to talk about actual systems, as well as in-depth presentations by the student themselves on specific research topics relating to their projects.

Typically, the lectures include an introduction to the new types of cyber-physical systems, e.g., the smart grid. Open research problems in relation to distributed operations, data-processing and cyber security are discussed, e.g., through lectures on streaming, security and privacy, and communication suitable in this domain. Examples of cyber-physical systems important for society are presented, e.g., the smart grid from both on the transmission and distribution perspective. The course starts with an introduction to power systems, to give students enough knowledge of terminology to understand papers connected to the smart grid.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or equivalent is required. The student should have successfully completed the following courses (or equivalent):
