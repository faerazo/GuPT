## About

The course treats infinite-dimensional vector spaces, where the vectors most often are functions of some sort. Using a so-called norm you can measure their size and define limits and other concepts. Important theorems treat different kinds of limits and compactness. You will also study interpolation problems and surprising continuity properties. The course gives you a framework to better understand many linear phenomena, for example complex measures. The course is one of the first you will take as a graduate student in mathematics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to the course MMA110 Integration Theory.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
