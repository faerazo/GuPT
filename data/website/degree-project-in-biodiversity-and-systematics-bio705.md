## Summary

This course is primarily for you that are interested in doing your own project in biodiversity and systematics. By carrying out an individual project associated to one of our research groups you will gain insight in current research as well as research methodologies.

## About

During the degree project course you are given the opportunity to deepen both your practical and theoretical knowledge of biodiversity and systematics. You will carry out an individual project, closely linked to current research, usually within one of the ongoing research projects at the Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences.

You will spend most of the time collecting and analysing data, but you are expected to take part in all steps from planning to presenting the results. Hence, at the end of the course you should have acquired good knowledge of research methodologies relevant for the specific subject.

The focus and scope of the project is determined in consultation between you and your supervisor, and you must contact potential supervisors to discuss possible projects well in advance before the course starts. Who you should contact depends on what type of research you are interested in. If you consider an external project (e.g. at other institutions, industries or governmental agencies) you should contact the course coordinator to discuss the feasibility.

Research within biodiversity and systematics at the department includes several areas, and may focus on either plants, fungi or animals. More information about current research projects as well as contact information can be found at the department’s web-page.

You are expected to have an approved project and supervisor before the course starts. The degree project usually covers two semesters (60 hec) but may also be limited to 30 or 45 hec. Regardless, you have to apply for the 30 hec-course; the technicalities are sorted out when the course starts.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course a Bachelor's degree in Biology, Molecular biology or Environmental sciences with focus on biology is required.In addition the courses BIO401 Alphataxonomical Principles (5 ects) given by Gothenburg University and 1BG393 Fundamental and molecular systematics (10 ects) given by University of Uppsala, and available within NABiS - Nordic Masters Programme in Biodiversity and Systematics, or equivalent courses, must be completed.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

You will be stationed in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B). Some projects may also include time at the marine research station at Kristineberg outside Fiskebäckskil.

## Recommended study route

The main part of the course consists of the individual project, where you should work independently, but under supervision. The literature is mainly scientific papers related to the specific topic. In addition, a mandatory seminar series, aimed at helping you with planning, analysis and presentation is include in the course. You are also expected to participate in research seminars etc. given at the department.

You will present your work both orally and as a written report at the end of the course, but other mandatory assignments are included in the examination. It also includes assessment of the practical implementation of the project. The evaluation criteria are available via  XXXXX
