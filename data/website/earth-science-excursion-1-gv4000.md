## Summary

As a professional Earth Scientist, you need practical experience in unfamiliar geological settings. The course consists of an excursion of two to three weeks and project work.

Field work and surveys are adapted to current issues in the relevant geological area - an exciting opportunity to see new landscapes and build a greater understanding of geological processes.

## About

The course includes the ability to independently interpret and discuss geological and natural geographic variations based on general principles by combining knowledge from your previous courses.

The project work is completed with a written and oral presentation of the tasks performed.

The course involves additional costs for the student. If you are a programme student, you can apply for a scholarship from the  Adlerbertska Foundations.

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.
