## About

The course gives a solid basic knowledge of stochastic processes, intended to be sufficient for applications on undergraduate and masters levels in engineering and natural sciences, as well as for selected applications on graduate level. The purpose is to give an applied treatment of stochastic processes, in part by means of applications and examples. The following topics are included:

- elements of time series with random walks,
- Brownian motion and elements of diffusions,
- Gaussian processes,
- stationarity and weak stationarity,
- elements of continuous time Markov chains and queues,
- elements of filtering and forecasting.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge corresponding to the courses MMG200 Mathematics 1, MMG300 Multivariable Analysis, and MSG110 Probability theory.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
