## Summary

The course offers you theoretical explanation and practical training in quantitative methodology relevant to your fields of study.

## About

The course begins with giving you an overview of issues of general relevance to research design in the social sciences, covering issues of epistemology, theory, research ethics, and also giving you an overview of the quantitative methods that are at the researchers’ disposal. The course is recommended for students with no or very little previous training in quantitative/statistical methods.

In the second part of the course you will learn how to use quantitative methods and the software, Stata, required to complete various tasks and analyses.

To the extent possible, course assignments employ data relevant to your main field of study in order to familiarise you with the content, the potential and the limitations of existing data.
