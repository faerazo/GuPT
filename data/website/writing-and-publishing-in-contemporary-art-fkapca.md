## Summary

Writing and Publishing in Contemporary Art is an advanced level course aimed at those wanted to develop a writing and publishing practice in the field of contemporary art. The course is for those who wish to write and publish as a contemporary artistic practice as well as those who intend to write and publish about contemporary art as a subject.

## About

The course is organised and structured through four interconnected modules. In module one, students contextualise and analyse the field using global theoretical, political, social perspectives. In module two, students investigate and apply methods and methodologies of contemporary writing and publishing practices. In module three, differing professional roles and positions in the field are introduced and engaged with and in module four, students design and produce a professional portfolio of writing and publishing. Collectively, the modules offer an extensive and deep engagement with this area of study. Students are expected to be independently developing their practice throughout the course and will receive individual tutoring and feedback on this development.

Writing and Publishing in Contemporary Art is taught by a wide range of practitioners active and experienced in the field.

**Course Sessions**

The course is taught in English and entirely at distance via Zoom. The course consists of lectures, seminars, workshops, individual tutorials and group critique sessions. The course runs throughout the autumn semester 2024 and continues during spring semester 2025. There is one class meeting per week and it is expected that students work independently between classes.
