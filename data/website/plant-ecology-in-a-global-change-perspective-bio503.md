## Summary

Plants play a fundamental and irreplaceable role in sustaining life on Earth, serving as the cornerstone of ecosystems and providing vital resources essential for human survival. This course provides an in-depth exploration of the interactions between plants and their environment, focusing on the relationships that shape communities and ecosystems.

## About

Why do some plant species

grow here but not there? What factors determine where a particular species can

survive? Why is diversity so much higher in some regions than others? How can

so many species coexist? These are some of the fundamental questions that

ecologists have discussed (and argued about!) for centuries. In this course we

will learn how to answer many of these questions, and apply this knowledge to

our rapidly changing world. What does our understanding of these processes tell

us about how plant species will respond to environmental change? Which species

will be the winners and losers of environmental change? Where will diversity

decrease (or increase!) the most under climate warming? And what – if anything

– should we do to prevent the loss of plant biodiversity?

The course is highly interactive and contains, in

addition to lectures, practical work in the field and laboratory, discussion

seminars, theoretical exercises, and individual and group projects with student

presentations.

**Teaching**

The

course consists of about 10 weeks of full-time studies and is divided into a

theoretical part followed by a practical part. Except lectures, all course

components are compulsory, since they develop the skills and approaches that

are included in the learning objectives in a way that is not possible through

self-study. Examination takes place through a written examination, active

participation in seminars and exercises, as well as student presentations of

individual and group projects.
