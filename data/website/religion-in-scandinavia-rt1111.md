## About

This course provides an orientation about how religious beliefs and

practices in Scandinavia, with a focus on Western Sweden, have

influenced and been influenced by cultural and societal conditions and

processes of change. Special attention is payed to how, what we today

call “Religion”, historically has been intertwined with and part of

everyday life, culture and politics. In this course, a few more

important historical events and time periods such as Christianization

process, the Reformation, the emergence of reviewal movements and the

contemporary religiously pluralistic Sweden are emphasized. By studying

these, Religion in Western Sweden is situated in its national,

Scandinavian and global contexts.
