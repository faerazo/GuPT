## About

Analytic number theory is the part of number theory that uses methods

from analysis to answer questions about integers in general and prime

numbers in particular. The subject became an independent part of number theory during the 19th century, when works by Dirichlet and Riemann, among others, showed that methods from complex analysis could be used to study the distribution of primes among the natural numbers. Riemann only wrote one ten-page paper in analytic number theory, but his ideas have permeated much of the research in the field during the last 150 years.

Riemann’s fundamental insight was that the distribution of primes is

intimately connected to a complex function called the Riemann zeta

function. This function has since been thoroughly studied, not least in

connection with the so-called Riemann hypothesis which describes the

location of the zeroes of the zeta function.

In this course you will study arithmetic functions, Dirichlet series,

the Riemann zeta function, and Dirichlet L functions. We will use this

to prove the prime number theorem and the prime number theorem for

arithmetic progressions, which in various ways describe the distribution

of primes among the natural numbers.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of MMG700 Analytic Functions. The course MMG100 Elementary Number Theory is recommended but not required.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
