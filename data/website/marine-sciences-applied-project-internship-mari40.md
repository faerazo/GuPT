## About

This project course (Internship), is open to international (English speaking) students. During the internship, the student will, under supervision, perform a scientifically structured experimental or theoretical work in the field of marine sciences. The work is presented and assessed in the form of a written report.

As a student, you have the responsibility to search and find a project/work by contacting a researcher/supervisor. Choice of project assignment, as well as start and stop dates, are decided in a discussion with the researcher/supervisor.

If you are interested in doing an internship in one of the research groups at the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper), University of Gothenburg, you need to take the following steps:

1. Apply for this course and send documents proving your eligibility ( [Documents needed](https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/apply-to-masters/provide-application-documents-masters/required-documents/)).
