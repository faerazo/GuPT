## Summary

This course gives you insight in factors that affect various types of watercourses, and thereby affect the situation for organisms that live in the water. You will also get practical training in methods for habitat management and conservation.

## About

This course provides an understanding of the abiotic and biotic factors that create and alter a watercourse, and how these relate to and are affected by adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. The focus is on ecological processes, competition and predation, food webs and trophic dynamics but also nutrient transport and flow calculations are key components.

Great emphasis is placed on practical habitat care and fish conservation, and you will receive training in various methods for estimating the production of fish (electrofishing) and restoration of habitats in running water using standardized methods. Identification exercises, where you will learn to identify various benthic organisms and their ecological roles are also included.

**Teaching**

The teaching takes the form of lectures, seminars, laboratory sessions and a project of your own that you present in both written and oral form.
