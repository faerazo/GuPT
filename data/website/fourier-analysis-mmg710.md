## About

In this course you will learn how to expand functions in Fourier series,

that is, in sums of sine functions with different frequencies. As you

will see, this is a surprisingly effective method of solving many

partial differential equations, for example to describe musical

instruments. You will also learn about the important question of

convergence for Fourier series, and learn to view them in a geometric

light. The continuous counterparts – the Fourier and Laplace transform – are also included in the course.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to 60 credits in mathematics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
