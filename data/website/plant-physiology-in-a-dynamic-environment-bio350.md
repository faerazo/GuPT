## Summary

This course is aimed at you who are interested in learning more about how plants, cyanobacteria and algae in different environments (sea, land, rivers and lakes) adapt physiologically to changed living conditions (both normally occurring and those caused by man, for example climate change).

## About

The course covers the physiology of plants (land and marine) and their close relatives (cyanobacteria and algae) from the cellular level to the organism level. The focus is on how the environment affects basic physiological processes such as photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and metabolism, reproduction, aging, and programmed cell death. The course also includes how plants respond to abiotic stresses (nutrient limitation, salinity, cold, heat, excess light, high CO2) and related adjustments. This is also illustrated through the laboratory work examining how plants and algae respond to various stress factors.

Teachers are active researchers from plant molecular and cell biology, ecophysiology and marine ecology at the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences.

The course is open to bachelor's, master's and exchange students in biology, molecular biology, conservation biology, environmental and marine science. The course was given for the first time in the spring of 2015 and has since received excellent evaluations.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Alternative 1: Completed basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology,2/3 ecology and biodiversity and systematics, or equivalent, of which at least 45 credits must be approved. In addition, English B is required.

Alternative 2: The following courses must be completed: ES1201, Environmental Sciences: Natural Science, 15 credits, ES1300, Natural Resource Management, 15 credits, ES1305, Pollutants effects and dispersal on Biological Systems, 15 credits, ES1220 Ecology and evolution for environmental scientists, 15 credits and one of the following three courses: BIO900, Cell Biology, 15 credits, BIO906, Molecular Genetics and Evolution, 15 credits, BIO283, Conservation Ecology in Water Environments, 15 credits, or an equivalent basic course in environmental science with a scientific focus. At least 60 of 75 credits must be approved.

Alternative 3: 90 hp of 120 hp in courses on the initiall two years of the Marine Science Bachellor program at GU should be approved.

For all alternatives, applicants must also prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish upper secondary school. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

The teaching is mainly conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7b).

## Recommended study route

The course is highly interactive. In addition to lectures, group discussions and laboratory work, a project work in a relevant topic chosen by you under the supervision of one of the course teachers and presented for fellow students is also included in the course.

Mandatory attendance is required for group discussions, laboratory sessions as well as project presentations.

There is no specific book that you will use during this course. The necessary material will be made available by the teachers via CANVAS. Research articles are used as a basis for lectures. Students will also read additional articles in preparation for group discussions and individual projects.
