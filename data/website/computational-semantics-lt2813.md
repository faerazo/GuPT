## Summary

The course introduces students to the current AI methods of modelling natural language and meaning it expresses.

## About

In this course we will discuss ways of representing meaning of words, sentences and conversations with computational methods, both top-down rule-based representations and data-driven representations learned by machine learning. We will contrast them with each other, examine how we can draw inferences or reason with them computationally, and how can they be applied in different language technology tasks and applications.

Topics include:

•    natural language meaning, inference, ambiguity and similarity

•    formal rule-based representations and techniques

•    distributional vector-space models estimated from data

•    machine learning-based distributed and contextualised word embeddings and language models

and others.

## Prerequisites and selection
