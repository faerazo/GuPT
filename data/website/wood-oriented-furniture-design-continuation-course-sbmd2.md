## Summary

This is a freestanding course that includes a full-time semester study in design with specialization in Wood Oriented Furniture Design. The course is aimed at those who already have some experience in design and wood on a university level, and who want to develop within the field.

## About

Throughout this course you will join in the second semester of the BFA Program in Wood Oriented Furniture Design. During this semester you will have the opportunity to deepen your knowledge and understanding of wood materials and techniques.

Teaching takes the form of lectures and exercises with supervision, workshops and briefings. The language of instruction is English.

The course is part of the international environment at the Academy of Design and Crafts, HDK, at [Campus Steneby](https://www.gu.se/en/hdk-valand/about-us/campus-steneby-where-people-ideas-and-materials-meet).
