## About

In this course, you will learn how to analyze scientific data using statistics and machine learning. You will focus on Bayesian inference, which is a way of measuring how likely something is based on facts and evidence. You will apply Bayesian inference to real-world problems in natural and engineering sciences, and try to reproduce some cutting-edge scientific results. The students will use the Python programming language, with relevant open-source libraries, and will learn to develop and structure computer codes for scientific data analysis projects.
