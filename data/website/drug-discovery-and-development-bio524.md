## About

The course in Drug Discovery and Development aims to give you an overall understanding of the discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals (drug discovery/development). It covers target selection, lead discovery/optimization, non-clinical in vitro/in vivo safety and efficacy studies, clinical trials, and market authorization. The course also highlights examples of existing drugs, how they have been developed, and their mechanisms of action.

### Teaching

The course is mostly theoretical, but also includes practical demonstrations. You will also perform an individual project work in the form of writing a scientific report and giving an oral presentation at the end of the course.

Many of the lectures are given by key experts from the industry who have developed different types of drugs and taken them to late stage clinical trials or the market. They will illustrate the theoretical part of the course with examples by incorporating problem-based learning. They will also introduce their organisations (such as RISE and Astra Zeneca) as potential future employers.

This course is taught in English.
