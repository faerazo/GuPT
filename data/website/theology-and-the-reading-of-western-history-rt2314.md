## About

Is Western modernity really a natural consequence of Europe?s long Christian history? Or is modernity rather to be seen as antithetical to Christianity? What are the theological roots of secular society?

In this course, these kinds of questions are explored through a careful study of the relation between Christian theology and the development of modernity from historical, philosophical, social-scientific, and theological perspectives. A deeper knowledge of this relation is important in order to understand the conditions of theology in modern society, both in academy and church, and also in order to be able to participate in the public debate on these issues.
