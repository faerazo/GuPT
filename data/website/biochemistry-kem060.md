## About

The course Biochemistry covers two central parts of biochemistry: cell metabolism and genetic information.

In the first part, you will learn how living cells extract energy, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. You will also learn how photosynthesis works. The course also covers how these processes are regulated.

In the second part, you will get an insight into how genetic information is stored in the cell, how it is copied during cell division, and how it is used for protein synthesis.

A major focus of the course is on practical labs where you will learn different biochemical methods, experimental design, and how to present scientific results. The course is given on Bachelors’ level and requires previous basic biochemical knowledge.

### Teaching

The course consists of traditional lectures and discussion seminars. Practical labs where you are introduced to common biochemical methods and trained in presenting experimental results, are an important part of the course. The course also includes computer labs and a poster session where you, together with a classmate, get the chance to present a subject of your choice.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to course, approved result on course KEM011 Basic chemistry 1 (15 credits) and KEM021 Basic chemistry 2 (15 credits), or equivalent knowledge, is required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course Biochemistry is included in the Bachelor’s programme in chemistry and is also included in the teacher’s education. The course can also be applied for as an elective course in several other Bachelor’s programmes.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
