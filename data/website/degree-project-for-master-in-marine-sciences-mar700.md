## Summary

The course provides advanced knowledge in any of the research areas of marine sciences. The course can be used in a master's degree in marine sciences and the student can choose a project focusing on oceanography, biology, chemistry, or geology.

## About

The student carries out a supervised independent

scientific project that may consist of experimental work or the analysis

and evaluation of existing scientific data. The finished work is

presented in writing in the form of a scientific report and an oral

presentation.

The work can be done at the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper/our-research), at another department in a relevant discipline, or externally at a company,

institution or authority, and is supervised by scientifically trained

researchers. To be registered on the course requires an approved

individual study plan. The degree course may also, in agreement with the

institution, be registered as 30 or 45 credits.

As a student, you have the responsibility to find a supervisor and

contact an examiner. In connection

with these contacts, you should show that you have taken the courses

required for the subject area. Choice of project assignment is done in a

discussion with the examiner and the supervisor. The date for starting

the course is also decided in the discussions with subject examiner and

supervisor. For project suggestions see [the degree project catalogue](https://www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper/study-here/degree-project-catalogue).
