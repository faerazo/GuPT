## Summary

The aim of this course is to develop your writing skills in Somali and help you plan, structure and create written documents for different contexts.

## About

Principles for written production and linguistic norms and rules are treated in direct connection with different practical written assignments. The students practice and develop their skills in editing text on the basis of such aspects as aim, receiver, intelligibility and language correctness. In the course, basic textual concepts are also treated and the students analyse texts of different kinds from communicative and structural perspectives. This theory and analysis is related to the students' own skills through work with the written exercises that are part of the course.
