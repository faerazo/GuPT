## About

The course Analytical Chemistry: Introductory Course provides an introduction to modern quantitative analytical chemistry with an emphasis on spectroscopic, chromatographic and electrochemical methods. You will learn basic analytical nomenclature and statistics, as well as sampling and sample preparation techniques.

The course is at a basic academic level. It is an advantage if you have knowledge in mathematics equivalent to 15 higher education credits when you read this course.

### Teaching

The course content is delivered through a series of lectures with accompanying calculation exercise and laboratory classes. The calculation exercises will provide support for your understanding of modern quantitative analytical chemistry. The laboratory classes will highlight current analytical problems and provide support for the theoretical part of the course. Almost half of the course is laboratory work.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to the course, completed courses KEM011 Basic chemistry 1 (15 credits) and KEM021 Basic chemistry 2 (15 credits) or equivalent knowledge are required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor’s programme in Chemistry (N1KEM)

- Bachelor’s programme in Medicinal Chemistry (N1LMK)

- Bachelor's programme in Molecular Biology (N1MB1)

- Bachelor's programme in Environmental Science (N1MVN)

- Bachelor's programme in Marine Science (N1MAV)

- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)

- Teacher Training programme (L1LÄR)


The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

There is great demand for analytical chemists in various industries. The course also provides a strong knowledge base for further study of chemistry or related disciplines at a master’s or doctoral level.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
