## About

The advanced courses can be applied for in 30-credit course packages (NEK20) or each course separately if you are only taking a single course.

**Microeconomic Theory**

Here you will deepen your knowledge of microeconomics and learn more about the theory of consumer and business decision-making. Individual markets are then linked together in the theory of general equilibrium, which is how we can look at the economy as a whole. Deviations from the perfect competition model in the form of, for example, competitive constraints and externalities are studied. The theories are formulated in mathematical form to a greater extent than in the basic course. A course in microeconomics is a good gateway to more specialised courses such as financial economics, development economics or environmental economics, which in turn can lead to essay writing using theories and statistical methods.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires previous knowledge of "Economics: Introductory level, 30 ECTS" or equivalent, of which at least 15 ECTS (including microeconomics 7.5 ECTS) must be completed.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.

## Facilities

Most of the Business School's operations are located at Vasagatan 1, but we also have premises at Viktoriagatan 13. The premises at Vasagatan 1 house the financial library, which is several floors high and has many study places.
