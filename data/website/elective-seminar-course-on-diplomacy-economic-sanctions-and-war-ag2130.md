## About

Powerful states often seek to cause other states to comply with their interests. Traditionally, scholars see economic sanctions as the classic tool of coercion in world affairs. Yet, the repertoire of influence is considerably broader - it includes diplomacy and negotiation on the softer side, and even war on the harder side. One could even include cultural or ideational factors among the ways in which states maximize their influence in world affairs.

In this course, we study the various ways in which power is exerted among states, we draw on multiple historical examples, and we discuss which strategies are likely to continue to be popular in the 21st century.
