## About

This course is intended to give basic knowledge about methods for the design and analysis of real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications.

An embedded system is a computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions. It is embedded in the sense that it is part of a complete device, often including electrical hardware and mechanical parts. For reasons of safety and usability, some embedded systems have strict constraints on non-functional behavior such as computational delay and periodicity. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications. This course is intended to give basic knowledge about methods for the design and analysis of real-time systems
