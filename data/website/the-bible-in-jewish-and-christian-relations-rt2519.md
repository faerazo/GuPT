## About

In this course, we deal with the concepts of Bible and canon and problematize them as a uniform concept. We will discuss Jewish and Christian notions about the origin, scope, content and usage of the Bible. Various interpretative principles of Jewish and Christian traditions will be analyzed and contrasted. In addition to that, we will study Church Fathers, contemporary Jewish and Christian texts, as well as early rabbinical texts, with a focus on the role of canonical writings in different interpretation communities. The course will provide tools for critical studies of both Christian and Jewish traditions to illuminate different perspectives on the Biblical texts for Jewish-Christian relations. During the course, knowledge of historical events is of central importance since they are foundational for the exegesis in both Jewish and Christian traditions.
