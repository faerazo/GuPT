## About

The course examines the question of justice in the light of the contemporary ecological crisis. It highlights the connection between social and environmental sustainability and questions about justice, and asks whether, and, if so, how, different conceptions of justice can contribute to fostering a sustainable world. You are trained to analyse representations of justice in philosophy, literature and religion, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of influential contemporary conceptions, and to evaluate how contemporary theories can be altered or enriched to promote sustainability. We also focus on the role of the imagination in reflection on justice, and consider the potential of various philosophic, literary and religious ideas, aiming to expand our capacity to imagine a sustainable world.
