## Summary

This course is an introduction to the study of translation. It is designed for students who are interested in the real nature of translation and the many phases of the translator's task.

## About

The course is organized around a number of major themes, movements and events with the aim to establish various reference points for an understanding of translation: history of translation and translation in Sweden, power and gender, religion and popular culture. The course draws on different theories with their own approaches to thinking about translation, for example sociology and cultural studies, postcolonial studies, polysystem theory and manipulation school. It is designed for students who are interested in the real nature of translation and the many phases of the translator's task. While it is essential for students of literary translation, literatures and culture, it provides a valuable foundation of general knowledge for all students.
