## About

A major part of the research conducted in the field of religious studies with a focus on esotericism has a historical focus, but at the same time, esotericism is a living part of the contemporary religious landscape. Some researchers argue that esotericism permeates contemporary popular culture to the extent that we today can talk about an "occulture", in which esoteric ideas and symbols linked to, for example, magic, alchemy and astrology, can be found in everything from TV series, movies, music, art, and literature to computer games, and, not least, on social media. At the same time, it is evident that more traditional forms of esotericism, such as initiatory societies and the practice of magic and alchemy, are still important elements in contemporary esotericism. In this course, contemporary, "lived" esotericism is identified, discussed and analyzed, with the focus on how esotericism is practised and expressed today. Central theories and methods relevant to the field of esotericism are discussed continuously during the course. The students are given the opportunity to immerse themselves in a specific aspect of contemporary esotericism through an individual paper (research report).
