## About

The course examines and discusses conceptions and norms about family and nationality. An important starting point is how the notion of family is given meaning in relation to nation-building. The focus is on Sweden, but throughout the course, there are digressions and comparisons with other countries and nation formations, both historically and today. Some of the themes addressed include how family and parenthood are constantly transformed, gender equality norms, and queer perspectives on family. These perspectives are important entry points, as are the ideas about the Swedish family that create notions of ‘the others,’ those who are not included in the imagined national community. The situation for families with migration experience is highlighted

## Prerequisites and selection
