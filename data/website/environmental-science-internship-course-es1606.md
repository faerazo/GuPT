## About

Our internship course gives you an opportunity to apply your knowledge from the environmental education in practical work at a company, a public organization or in an environmental organization.

To be admitted to the course, you must have contacted a workplace on your own. If they want to receive you, you must fill in a form together with the supervisor at the internship site that is sent to the course coordinator no later than before the start of the course.

The institution has no obligation to provide internships or alternatives. Thus, you have to find an internship on your own to be able to take the course. Therefore, apply for an internship well in advance!

The work is assessed based on how the internship is conducted and through a written report.
