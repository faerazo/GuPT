## Summary

Are you interested in remote sensing and GIS as research and analysis method?

The Remote Sensing and GIS course provides you with knowledge about remote sensing as an anlytical method, practical applications such as drone missions, and communication and vislualisation of results.

## About

The course Remote Sensing and GIS aims to provide knowledge and in-depth application of GIS ans remote sensing.

The majority of the course is devoted to practical exercises with remote sensing and GIS software which, together with lectures, provide an introduction to theory, applications, drone flight planning, data analysis and scripts (e.g. Python, R) for data processing.

During the course you will be introduced to various software related to remote sensing and GIS. Both commercial and open source software will be used, such as 2D (e.g. satellite spectral data) and 3D (e.g. point clouds from LiDAR or photogrammetry).

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- practical exercises
- lectures
- reading of literature
- discussion seminars
- excursion
- computer exercises

Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to the course, 7,5 credits in Geographic Information Systems and at least 45 credits in the main field of Earth Sciences, Geography or Marine Sciences is required. Applicants with equivalent education can, after review and approval, be given access to the course.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you study Earth Science, you have good career opportunities both in Sweden and abroad. You can choose to work in industry, as a consultant, project manager or in public administration.

Our former students work, for example, with natural resource management, environmental issues and urban planning, you also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.
