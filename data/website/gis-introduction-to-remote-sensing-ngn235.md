## Summary

A 100% web-based introduction course to remote sensing. The course is suitable as an introductory course for those who are curious about current remote analysis data and its use as well as those who see remote analysis as an important part of their future work.

To be eligible to apply for the course you need to have basic knowledge of GIS.

## About

Daily satellite imagery, micro-satellites, drone data, Google Earth and LiDAR are just some of the exciting data sources available to researchers and the public.

Remote analysis is an important data source for the Geographic Information System (GIS), for example to detect changes in ground cover, to map the forest, as well as the topography with LiDAR data and to obtain images and 3D data with drones.

The course provides an introduction to 2D (e.g. Sentinel-2 data) and 3D (e.g. photogrammetry with drones, airborne LiDAR) remote analysis data sources for applications in the terrestrial environment, the theory behind remote analysis, information on access to data, data analysis exercises, and addresses future developments in the subject.
