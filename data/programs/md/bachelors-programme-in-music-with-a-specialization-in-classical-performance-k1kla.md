## Summary

The programme focuses on instrumental studies, chamber music and ensemble, and orchestra. As a student of the programme, you will be a part of an international environment characterized by dialogue and openness between students and teachers, with individual tuition given in English or Swedish. You will continue your artistic development as you enhance your instrumental and ensemble skills on your chosen instrument.

## About

Our programme is part of a wide range at the Academy of Music and Drama, a unique interdisciplinary meeting place with a pronounced international character. Together with students from the master’s programme in Symphonic Orchestra Performance, you will regularly participate in concerts with the University of Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. We also collaborate closely with the city’s most important music institutions, such as Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and Gothenburg Opera. The programme also collaborates in different projects with other professional institutions in southern Sweden.

### Teachers

### Preparing you for the future

You will be trained in musical theory, ear training, leading ensembles, music and society, ergonomics, ethics and aesthetics, music technology, learning through music, and future professional roles. As a student of the programme, you will participate in an environment where the interaction between interpretation and reflection is an obvious aspect of your artistic development. We also frequently host prominent guest conductors and musicians, increasing your exposure to professionals and giving you the opportunity to build a network.

### Well-rounded performance opportunities

Each semester, the students form chamber ensembles that are taught by experienced chamber music instructors and which present their work in performance or at concerts. Symphonic works are performed in collaboration with the master class of the University of Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. You will take part in ensemble performances as part of a chamber orchestra, brass ensemble, percussion ensemble, and the contemporary music ensemble, all of which include regular concert performances. The contemporary music ensemble works with 20th and 21st century repertoires in close cooperation with the master’s programme in Composition at the Academy of Music and Drama. Additionally, with the Academy of Music and Drama home to several diverse artistic programmes, there are excellent opportunities for collaborations with students in musical theatre, opera, composition, and improvisation, to mention a few.

### Focus on your artistic development

Your solo instrument is the focus of the programme and is integrated with your independent degree project. You will receive individual instruction for your solo instrument in addition to seminars, workshops, and master classes. If you play an orchestral instrument, you will also work with score study and teachers in musical rehearsal (pianists). Instrumental studies courses and chamber music, ensemble, and orchestra courses are integral to each semester of the programme, and also integrate content like stage and musical communication, ethics and aesthetics, relevant digital tools, and work with different types of audiences. You will have the opportunity to pursue exchange studies in the second or third semesters if you choose.

### Programme overview

Courses in instrumental studies, chamber music and ensemble, and orchestra will be a key part of each semester.

You will work on your independent degree project over two semesters, allowing time to continue instrumental studies and chamber music, ensemble, and orchestra in parallel. Your independent degree project will be a combination of performance and reflection of your musical progress with your solo instrument. You will have individual supervision throughout the process.
