## Summary

The master’s programme in Digital Leadership provides you the opportunity to gain deep understanding of how digitalisation transforms industries and society. As a student of the programme, you will develop a toolset for a leading role in responsibly shaping this transformation. Methods and techniques for analysing the implications of digitalisation will complement your skills to manage and lead change in complex environments. Our programme focuses on strategies to simultaneously leverage digitalisation and address potential negative effects.

## About

Digitalisation offers almost unlimited opportunities for firms, public authorities, and citizens. However, digitalisation is a force without conscience, and markets, organisations, and technologies can cause societal challenges. The programme requires the capability to navigate competing concerns of digitalisation, but also actively orchestrate digital innovation processes. In order to preserve valuable learned experiences, we must learn to navigate a new landscape where digitalisation needs to coexist with established proven practices. The programme has adapted to this changing landscape by providing you with capabilities in a variety of areas.

### A balanced response to digitalisation

Departing from technological change, our programme primarily focuses on management and leadership, and relates classical theories to contemporary research and current practice. The overall purpose of the programme is to give you a deep understanding of how digitalisation transforms society and to develop your capabilities for taking a leading role in embracing and shaping this transformation. We offer a broad theoretical foundation for understanding contemporary phenomena, and methods and techniques for analysing the implications of digitalisation. This balance of theory and practice supports you in developing your practical skills to deal with change in complex environments.

### A collaborative, practice-oriented education

Our programme works in close collaboration with industry partners, combining academic rigour with practical relevance, including your project work and possible thesis collaborations. You will develop your own question to explore while learning through project work, lectures, seminars, case studies, and individual supervision. Some of your classmates will already have a wealth of practical experience, providing a mutually beneficial learning environment to explore the management and leadership aspects of digitalisation.

[Chandraprabha Jha](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/former-student-in-digital-leadership-msc)

### Department and faculty

The programme is given by the [Department of Applied Information Technology](https://www.gu.se/en/applied-information-technology), at the [IT Faculty](https://www.gu.se/en/it-faculty).

### Full time studies

The programme is structured for intensive studying, meaning that we expect students to invest a full-time equivalent of work (40hrs/week) into in-class and independent study activities. The programme consists of short, intensive courses, allowing students to focus on one course at the time.

## Programme structure and content

We offer a hands on, full-time educational programme that is carefully designed on the principles of progression and continuity. This means that our courses are tightly integrated, with each subsequent course building on the content of its predecessors.

The first two semesters provide a solid foundation with eight mandatory courses:

- Technology
- Platforms
- Infrastructure
- Project Work I
- Organizing
- Governance
- Strategy
- Project Work II

For further specialization, we offer the following, recommended courses during the third semester:

- Entrepreneurship
- Work
- Sustainability
- Methods

As an alternative to the recommended courses during the third semester, you can choose elective courses from the University of Gothenburg or another university.

The final semester consists of your independent master’s thesis.

## Who should apply?

Are you an established IT practitioner who wants to take time to develop your skills and reflect on your experiences, in light of recent developments in digitalisation? Do you have experience outside of IT, but feel that digital leadership skills can help you make the next step? Are you curious about management in a digitalised society and want to contribute with your different perspective from a background such as management, engineering, sociology, psychology, political science, or law? Do you want an exciting and unconventional career in an increasingly digitalised society?

If your answer is yes - apply for the master's programme in Digital Leadership.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor's degree 180 credits including an independent project (degree project) of at least 15 credits or equivalent. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Assessment of qualifications

### FAQ

**I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics/Biology/Medieval History. Am I eligible to apply?**

Yes! There are no requirements for the subject of your bachelor’s degree.

**Does my bachelor’s have to include thesis project worth of 15 ECTS?**

Yes, this is a firm requirement. There are exceptions in rare cases (such as projects just under 15 ECTS). If you are unsure about your eligibility, contact the study counselor.

**Should I submit recommendation letters, motivation essay, CV, or work portfolio together with my application?**

No. You only need to submit documents related to the eligibility criteria listed on this page. Other material will not be considered.

## After graduation

[More information about facilities](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/campus-lindholmen)

## Exchange opportunities

During year two of the master's programme there are elective courses equivalent to 30 credits. As a student you have the opportunity to apply for exchange studies in Europe or in other parts of the world. Former students from our master's programmes have gained valuable experience when they have studied at our partner universities in, for example, Paris, Japan and Singapore. As an exchange student, you do not need to pay any semester fees and since the study abroad is credited in your degree, no extra study time is added to your education.
