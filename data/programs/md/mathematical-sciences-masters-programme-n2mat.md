## Summary

The master’s programme in Mathematical Sciences offers a large selection of courses across the whole spectrum of applied and pure mathematics. As a student of the programme, you will have the freedom to design your own study programme and choose courses from other subjects, tailoring your education to your specific interests and goals. You will engage in a broad range of research-based courses and develop the skills needed for a career at the forefront of research and development.

## About

The use of mathematical and statistical models and methods has facilitated tremendous advances in knowledge during the last century, increasingly utilized not only in natural sciences but also in medical, financial, and social sciences. Progress in mathematical sciences often stimulates new developments in fundamental sciences. The application of mathematical sciences is constantly growing, with ever-increasing data collection and computing possibilities making new applications feasible. Mathematicians and statisticians work in diverse areas of research and development—many of which influence the optimizing of resources with respect to the environment and the economy—such as:

- drug development
- mobile communication
- automotive and aerospace engineering
- encryption methods
- image processing and analysis
- computer graphics
- deep learning systems
- pricing of options
-  insurance risk assessment

### Strong and varied research connections

The Department of Mathematical Sciences has strong traditions in a broad range of research, both in pure and applied mathematics. We are a joint department of two universities in Gothenburg: The University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology. As the largest department in mathematical sciences in Sweden, we can offer a broad range of courses, which opens up opportunities for collaborations and several specializations. Our programme strives to be at the forefront of mathematical sciences and offers five specializations:

- mathematics
- applied mathematics
- mathematical statistics
- financial mathematics
- statistical learning and AI

Two of these specializations are not commonly found in similar programmes: financial mathematics and statistical learning and AI.

### Diverse options for future careers

Some specializations are more theoretical and research-oriented and will prepare you for further research and a career in academia. Other specializations are geared more towards applied mathematics and better prepare you for work within the private sector but could also lead to an academic career. Some specializations, such as mathematical statistics, can be more theoretical or applied depending on your interests

## Programme structure and content

There is a high degree of freedom and flexibility in our programme. There is one mandatory course for all specializations: Perspectives in Mathematics. There are two exclusive courses—closed to students outside our programme—that are based on solving real-world problems from industrial partners:

## Who should apply?

Are you interested in the mathematics underpinning our universe?

Do you want a career at the forefront of research and development?

Do you want to learn about novel applications of mathematics in fields such as machine learning? If you have a solid background and genuine interest in mathematics and want to prepare for a career in research and development inside or outside academia, then apply for the master’s programme in Mathematical Sciences.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree containing at least 75 credits in mathematics and mathematical statistics, of which at least 15 credits must be at an advanced level.Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test for example TOEFL or IELTS, or a degree from an English-language university.

### Selection

The selection is based on an overall qualitative assessment of the applicants' previous education and relevant work experience.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Science in Mathematics or Master of Science in Mathematical Statistics.

[More information about after graduation](https://gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/after-graduation-mathematical-sciences)

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Our buildings are located near the centre of Gothenburg in the Chalmers area, Campus Johanneberg. Here you find spacious and bright lecture halls, plenty of group rooms that the students like to use, reading room for own studies and several computer rooms.

Laplace is the student’s own lunch room, with a well-equipped kitchen area and cosy sofas. In the buildings you also find the student office and the student counsellors’ offices, as well as a large research library in mathematics that is also open to students. Wireless network is of course available in all premises. The communications are very good, with several tram and bus lines.
