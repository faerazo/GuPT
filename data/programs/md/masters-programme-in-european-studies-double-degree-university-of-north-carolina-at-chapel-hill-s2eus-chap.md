## About

This interdisciplinary double degree option focuses on contemporary Europe and the transatlantic relationship. Students learn about European integration, EU institutions, and comparative welfare states. They focus on the pressing concerns Europe and the transatlantic relations face today such as climate change, economic and social inequality, digitalization, security, globalization, and migration. Training in the methods of social science, critical inquiry and cultural adaptability prepare students to be independent analysts. We engage with alumni to provide current students opportunities to network with graduates who pursue careers in business, education, international diplomacy, politics, law, and research.

### Favoring students’ initiatives, choice, and activities
