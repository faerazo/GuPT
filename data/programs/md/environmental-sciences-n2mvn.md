## Summary

Environmental science studies the threats to our joint life and future on Earth, as well as the opportunities for human society to tackle these challenges. During this master’s programme in Environmental Sciences you will gain in-depth knowledge and competence regarding all aspects of environmental problems, ranging from causes and impacts to adaptation and mitigation measures. Afterwards, you will be prepared to work for a more sustainable future as an environmental expert.

## About

Scientific environmental knowledge is fundamental for ecological, social, and economic sustainability and is at the core of today’s crucial issues of climate change, air and water pollution, biodiversity loss, and poverty reduction. Society is in critical need of environmental experts that are well-founded in natural science, but at the same time have a good understanding of the societal context of environmental issues. This master’s programme educates such persons. Environmental issues are studied from three perspectives:

- Deepening knowledge of the causes and nature of different types of environmental problems

- Analyzing environmental problems from different perspectives, such as geographical patterns, temporal trends, magnitude, impacts and risk

- Exploring different types of mitigation, adaptation and solution possibilities to tackle environmental problems, e.g. through international agreements, policy making, company strategies, technological development, etc

## Programme structure and content

The program begins with a mandatory semester including four advanced environmental science courses, each worth 7.5 HEC:

- Global change – problem, analysis, measures

- Resource efficiency – energy, material flows and ecosystem services

- Environmental risk assessment and management

- Nature based solutions – potentials, pitfalls and goal conflicts

Thereafter, each student creates her/his own profile within environmental science by choosing elective courses, depending on background and interests. Second cycle courses in environmental science that are given by different departments at the Faculty of Science at the University of Gothenburg can be found at [https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/more-about-master-in-environmenta…](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/more-about-master-in-environmental-science). Other courses may also be included in the degree as long as the requirement of 90 HEC second cycle courses is fulfilled.

The program concludes with an Examination course in Environmental Science (30, 45 or 60 HEC).

## Who should apply?

Are you passionate about environmental work with a societal impact based on sound scientific knowledge? Do you think it is important to have international contacts for this type of work? Would you enjoy studying in an academic culture with relatively small classes and many opportunities to interact with the teachers?

If you are interested in both the natural science and social science dimensions of environmental issues, then apply to the master’s programme in Environmental Science.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor of Science (in environmental science with emphasis on natural science, biology, chemistry, earth science, geography with emphasis on natural science, physics, or equivalent) from a university, including at least 15 HEC in Environmental science. These prerequisites can be waived if an applicant has verifiable equivalent knowledge/skills. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se. For several of the elective courses there are additional entry requirements.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Science in Environmental Science.

Your career opportunities depend on the profile you built with your elective courses, but include a career as an environmental expert in both business and public sectors and further research in academia. Our graduates report job titles such as environmental officer, environmental consultant, environmental manager, researcher, and doctoral student.

Our alumni survey of 2018, which included students from 2012–2017, found that 85% found it easy to find jobs; 95% report their education was relevant for their present work; and 100% are happy with their jobs. We encourage continued collaboration with our alumni through guest lectures and workshops, and we organize alumni seminars where current students can interact with alumni.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B), but can also be conducted in other buildings, for example at the School of Business, Economics and Law.

Teaching is conducted in relatively small classes with close teacher contact. It is both theoretically and practically oriented, and takes the form of lectures as well as more interactive exercises, data analyses, group work and seminars. Individual courses also include study visits and internships. Depending on topic, there is also the opportunity for close contact with research groups and organizations outside university during the thesis project.

## Exchange opportunities

You have good opportunities to participate in an international exchange during a term. We have established contacts and exchange programs with several prominent universities abroad.

## Internship

Practical projects are key components in some courses, providing opportunities to work with companies and authorities. Some students chose to conduct their thesis projects at organizations outside academia, which is possible as long as they have an internal supervisor at the university.
