## Specialisations

## Purpose

The purpose of the education is to give the students the knowledge, skills and abilities that they need for a successful career in computer science. The programme is characterised by a large freedom of choice, and the students have both the opportunity and the responsibility to design their own profiles within the area of computer science.

This programme leads to a Degree of Master of Science (120 credits) with a major in Computer Science (Filosofie masterexamen med huvudområdet Datavetenskap).

## Entry requirements

## Entry requirements

A bachelor's degree of 180 credits within the field of computer science or equivalent, including a thesis or project of at least 6 credits.

At least 120 credits in total in computer science and mathematics, of which at least

- 7.5 credits discrete mathematics, and 10 additional credits in mathematics,
- 7.5 credits imperative or object oriented programming, and 7.5 additional credits in programming, as well as
- 7.5 credits data structures

(or equivalent).

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6 / English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

## Specific entry requirements for admission to a course within the study programme

Within the study programme there can be specific entry requirements for admission to individual courses. These specific entry requirements are documented in each course syllabus and state which entry requirements are necessary to be registered on a course within the study programme.

## Selection

Selection is according to the Higher Education Ordinance and the University of Gothenburg admission regulations for education on first and second cycle.

## Content

The programme is characterised by freedom of choice and offers a large number of courses in computer science. At present there are courses on topics such as algorithms, computer architecture, computer systems and networks, cyber-physical systems, data science, graphics, interaction design, logic, machine learning, programming, programming languages, security, and verification.

Study counsellors are available for the students, and the department recommends the students to contact the counsellors when planning their education.

The programme constrains the freedom through certain rules:

- To complete the degree a student must complete 120 credits.
- At least 60 credits, excluding the thesis project, must come from second cycle courses. At least 45 of those 60 credits must come from courses with Computer Science as a main field of study. Furthermore, at least 7.5 of those 45 credits must come from courses for which the entry requirements include at least 7.5 credits within advanced courses with Computer Science as a main field of study.
- The following course is compulsory:
  - The Computer Scientist in Society, 7.5 credits.
- A master's thesis project of at least 30 credits has to be completed within the main field of study Computer Science, through one of the following two courses:
  - Master's Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering, 30 credits.
  - Master's Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering, 60 credits.

## Language and Study form

The academic year is divided into two semesters and four study periods. A semester includes two study periods, each of 15 credits. Students normally attend two courses in parallel in each study period.

The education is conducted in the form of lectures, seminars, teacher-led exercises, and tutoring as well as projects in which students apply and deepen their knowledge.

The language of tuition is English.

## Other regulations

## Credit transfer of former education

In some cases, the student has the right to be given credit for former higher education according to the legislative regulations of the Higher Education Ordinance.

## Evaluation

The courses of the study programme are evaluated according to each course syllabus. The result will be used for planning and implementation of upcoming courses. A summary is given to students at the start of the courses.

The study programme will be followed up and evaluated in accordance with the applicable Policy för kvalitetssäkring och kvalitetsutveckling av utbildning vid Göteborgs universitet (Policy for the Quality assurance and Quality Development of Education at the University of Gothenburg).

## Revision of the syllabus

This syllabus is a revision of the syllabus confirmed by the IT Faculty Board, University of Gothenburg, on 10-10-2018 (reg. no. G 2018/510), revised on 02-09-2021 (reg. no. GU 2021/2277) and 20-08-2024 (reg. no GU 2024/2069) to be valid from Autumn semester 2025.

## Guaranteed admission

Students are guaranteed admission to all compulsory courses in the programme, as well as a number of elective courses, if they satisfy the courses' entry requirements and apply to the courses in prescribed ways and within prescribed application periods.
