## Summary

Our programme stimulates independent, critical, and creative minds. Insights and perspectives from disciplines such as media and communication studies, linguistics, organisation and management research, and sociology allow you to develop a comprehensive understanding of communication as a vibrant field of research and practice. Through courses and student-driven activities, we bring together people from all over the world with diverse professional and educational backgrounds.

## About

In recent years, society has become increasingly globalised, digitalised, and specialised. These trends pose a number of urgent and complex challenges, such as: listening and being heard in an arena of many competing voices; fostering inclusion, equality, and diversity in fast-changing work environments; and determining the accuracy of news in the face of increased user-generated content and information overload.

### Communication is key in meeting challenges

Our master’s programme posits communication as a decisive field that will allow students to develop a holistic understanding of communication as a vibrant field of research and practice that addresses these and other societal challenges. Our programme empowers you to grow as an independent, critical researcher and skilled professional, able to navigate the intricate dimensions of organisational and digital communication.

### One programme—two areas of specialisation

Insights and perspectives from disciplines such as media and communication studies, linguistics, organisation and management research, informatics, and sociology will foster your in-depth understanding of communication as a field of research and practice. With the support of our [Advisory Industry Panel](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/master-in-communication-industry-advisory-panel), we are committed to continuously improving the quality of the program and its ability to provide up-to-date communication skills and competences that are most needed in the current and future job market. You can choose an educational path that interests you after gaining advanced knowledge and skills in two areas of specialisation:

- Digital communication examines the role of digital technologies in communication—how they shape communication and how we can use them to study communication. This area of specialisation deals with how the continued digitalisation of society affects communication, for example, how emerging practices like wikis and memes challenge long-held assumptions concerning authorship. Another topic of study is how digital technologies can be used to study communication, for example analysing big textual data for sentiment in online communities.

- Organisational communication focuses on issues, approaches to, and challenges of communication within organisations, and between organisations and external stakeholders, including related fields such as corporate communication, public relations, and strategic communication. The programme addresses the unique challenges that organisations face in communicating with different external and internal stakeholders. It will also enable students to effectively implement a variety of communication techniques used in professional settings.

### A multicultural learning environment committed to sustainability, equality and inclusion

We prioritise interactive forms of learning. Problem-based learning in an intercultural environment strengthens your ability to collaboratively analyse and solve complex challenges. Matters of sustainability, equality, and inclusion are integral parts of our courses.

A number of other elective courses run at the master level at the department are also available to students of the programme

### Sem. 4

## Who should apply?

Are you interested in the application of rhetorical and argumentative strategies in organisational settings?

Do you wonder what role language, identity, power, and ethics play in communication? Do you want to dig deeper into particular schools of thought, theoretical approaches, and methods of empirical communication research?
