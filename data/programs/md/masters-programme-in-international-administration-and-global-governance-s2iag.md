## Summary

The Master’s Programme in International Administration and Global Governance (IAGG) applies insights from diverse disciplinary perspectives to issues of international relevance. You will develop the skills and knowledge needed to formulate, analyse, and evaluate policy related to long-term political, economic, and social development. You will be prepared for professional careers in the field of international affairs or further research at the doctoral level in an international environment with students from all over the world.

## About

### Two double degree options

In addition to studying Master's Programme in International Administration and Global Governance in Gothenburg there are two double degree options that you can apply for. See the links below for further information and instructions on how to apply for these.

[Double Degree Track, University of Konstanz, Germany](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/masters-programme-in-international-administration-and-global-governance-double-degree-track-university-of-konstanz)

[Double Degree Track, Fudan University in Shanghai, China](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/double-degree-option-fudan-university-shanghai )

### International Administration and Global Governance

International Administration and Global Governance involves everything from international agreements, declarations, and protocols to ideas and norms, from development aid to foreign policies. International trade, social and economic development, environmental protection, human rights, security, democratisation, state capacity development, and gender equality are all increasingly treated at the regional, transnational and international levels. In our programme, we explore and analyse the intentional and unintentional effects of both action and inaction by entities from international organisations and states to epistemic communities, NGOs, and citizen activists.

### A wide-ranging and interdisciplinary learning experience

The programme is offered jointly by the Department of Economics, the Department of Political Science, and the School of Global Studies. Throughout the programme, you will explore the historical development of the international system, critically examining the interrelations among actors on the international arena through various theoretical lenses. Building on this foundation, the programme explores specific policy issues in the broad areas of security, and environmental, economic, social, and political development.

•    Why do some societal issues make it onto the international policy agenda while other, equally compelling, issues do not?

•    What implications do international trade agreements have for producers, consumers, and the environment? And what are the implications if such agreements fail to materialise?

•    How can we understand that the same policy approach in development cooperation may have highly divergent impacts in different national settings?

In analysing such questions, you will develop the skills and abilities needed to understand and contribute to finding ways forward on the complex challenges facing the world today.

## Programme structure and content

**The first semester** explores the historical development of the international system, with a focus on the relations among international organisations and between international organisations and various state and non-state actors. You will explore the primary policy theories in areas such as peace and conflict studies, and economic, social, and political development.

**The second and third semesters** offer opportunities for pursuing your individual areas of interest through elective courses, an optional internship, or studies abroad. A research methods course in the third semester equips you with advanced knowledge of social science research methods that will assist in your thesis work. We offer students the choice of four different courses, two in quantitative and two in qualitative research methods, which cater to beginners as well as students with more advanced methods backgrounds.

**The fourth semester** offers an opportunity to apply and further develop your methodological skills and area expertise from previous semesters in your final master’s thesis.

## Who should apply?

- Do you want to gain a deeper understanding of the international system and processes of change?
- Are you intrigued by who makes policies, the ideas and interests involved behind them, and who is affected by them?
- Do you want the skills to find, evaluate, integrate, and generate information and knowledge on complex issues of relevance to the international policy community?
- Do you want to study in an international environment with other students from all over the world?


Then apply for the Master’s Programme in International Administration and Global Governance.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

[More information about facilities](https://www.gu.se/en/social-sciences/study-here/campus-haga)

## Exchange opportunities

In addition to personal development and an increased understanding of the outside world, studying abroad gives you a sharper resume with international experience. Students who have studied abroad have and continue to develop characteristics such as adaptability, the ability of initiative and ability to handle unexpected situations. In addition, you improve your language skills and gain an international network of friends for life!

During your studies, you have the opportunity to study one semester abroad. We co-operate with universities in countries such as France, Austria and China. Start planning your exchange studies early so you know when to go and when you need to apply.

[More information about exchange opportunities](https://studentportal.gu.se/en/go-international/exchange-studies?i_sk=1)

## Internship

You can do an internship, in Sweden or abroad, during the elective semester of the programme. Many students state that the internship is the best thing they have done during their studies! It provides new perspectives and prepares you for your future working life. You also get the chance to network, which has proven to be important when looking for jobs.

You choose and apply for an internship yourself, but it must be approved by the Department of Political Science. One of the requirements is that you can be offered qualified assignments that involve independent analytical work, where you develop what you have learned during your studies. Examples of common internship organisations are embassies, authorities, consultancy agencies and international organisations such as the EU and the UN.
