## Purpose

The overall aim of the programme is to provide advanced knowledge and analytical skills relevant to different aspects of European development, with a special emphasis on integration and disintegration in the EU and Europe. The programme is inter- and multidisciplinary and addresses a broad range of topics within the field of European Studies including legal, political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of contemporary European development and integration, as well as its historical background. The programme will provide students with the knowledge and skills needed for both professional careers in and post-graduate research related to important European developments. The European processes encompass not only activities at the supranational European level, but also how old and new member states and citizens are affected, and how various actors (e.g. private companies, local/regional authorities, social movements) seek to influence integration or disintegration in Europe.

The programme equips students with the analytical skills to assess European actors involved in the integration processes, implications of supranational decision-making, as well as to formulate strategies to operate effectively in the European arena.

The academic spirit of the programme is the creation of a critical stance, fostering of independent thinking as well as the promotion of an urge and an ability to formulate original questions rather than to convey ready-made answers. All courses of the programme are closely linked up with current research, with a special emphasis on multidisciplinary academic studies on European developments. Methodologically, the programme builds on a research-like approach implying the reading of research literature, own academic writing, problem solving, and oral presentations and discussions in the form of academic seminars.
