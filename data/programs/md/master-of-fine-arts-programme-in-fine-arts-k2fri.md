## Summary

This international master’s programme equips you to make impactful and critical artistic contributions to society. With a focus on the challenges of being public together and the roles of art and artists in producing publicness, you will develop introductory-level skills in artistic research. In a small, diverse cohort, you will learn from experienced teachers who bring both academic expertise and professional artistic practices to the table.

## About

In an era marked by complex societal challenges, the relationship between art, artists, and publicness must be critically examined, revitalized, and practiced. This international programme is dedicated to these crucial enquiries. Central to the curriculum are the questions of what you produce, when, how, and for whom. These questions intersect with ethics, aesthetics, artistic methods, and materials, encouraging the development of dissemination strategies that often deviate from conventional exhibition formats.

Artistic Enquiries are projects specifically designed to expand knowledge, not just for you but for broader audiences. These projects are developed through learning and applying research methods and skills that integrate art practices with theoretical and contextual frameworks. Writing and documenting your processes are also essential components.

Over four terms, you will learn to create increasingly specific and nuanced artistic projects, each with its own unique system and logic, addressing questions of publicness and the role of art and the artist.

**You will gain the ability to:**

• Analyse societal challenges and phenomena from an artist's perspective.

• Apply artistic research skills while producing meaningful artworks and projects.

• Create art projects that are rigorous in their planning and execution.

• Define how your art and projects are shared, ensuring clarity in their communication.

• Articulate the significance of your art practices.

With these sharpened skills in critical thinking, production, and communication, you will be well-equipped to test the boundaries of what art is and does, contribute to debates on the role of the artist, and confidently argue for the relevance of your work.

**Three core objectives**

Teaching is delivered through a blend of lectures, seminars, workshops, and projects, balanced with self-directed and peer-to-peer learning. Your progress will be assessed through a combination of coursework, as well as oral and written examinations, focusing on three core objectives:

• Knowledge and understanding

• Skills and abilities

• Judgement and evaluation

**Extensive network**

HDK-Valand is proud of its extensive network of local, national, and international partnerships, including with [L’Internationale Online](https://internationaleonline.org), the Hasselblad Center, and Röda Sten Konsthall. It has a strong research culture with externally-funded research projects and research centres, including [CAPIm–The Centre for Art and the Political Imaginar](https://capim.se) y. It is also home to the [PARSE](https://parsejournal.com) platform for artistic research. You will benefit from a rich array of public symposia, seminars, lectures, and conferences. The programme is actively building a network of cultural actors focused on art and publicness in the Gothenburg area. Students are facilitated to build their own networks.

## Programme structure and content

In the first year, you will explore concepts of publicness and the roles of art and artists in society and try out artistic research. You'll learn to identify topics to work with, experiment with artistic production, analyse theories, and hone your writing skills. During the second term, you will participate in an elective course, broadening your knowledge alongside students from other specializations. Students apply for the elective courses based on an annual course offering.

The second year deepens your artistic research abilities, with a focus on artistic strategies, media, materials, decision-making, and theoretical relevance. In the third term, you will compose a substantial text on a key area of interest, continuing with production and planning for the public dissemination of your work. The final term is dedicated to the production, contextualization, and public dissemination of your artistic project, culminating in a cooperative project with classmates, faculty, and external partners.

## Who should apply?

This programme is ideal for students from diverse backgrounds who want to critically engage with societal challenges through art. Whether you’re interested in publicness, redefining art's role, or gaining skills in artistic research, this programme will push you beyond conventional boundaries. If you are curious about theory, enjoy working independently and collaboratively, and are ready to challenge yourself and others constructively, this is the right programme for you. Proficiency in artistic media and a passion for questioning the status quo are essential.
