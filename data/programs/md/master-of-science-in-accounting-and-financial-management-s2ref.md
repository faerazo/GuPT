## Summary

The Master's programme in Accounting and Financial Management includes rigorous exploration of financial accounting, management accounting, and financial management. Faculty active in research, practice, and policy setting, will equip you to produce and analyse high quality information to guide organisations in investment decisions, planning, performance evaluation, restructurings, and funding activities. We emphasise interaction between theory and practice and contemporary development within digitalisation and sustainability.

## About

Accounting and financial management are crucial for firm performance and economic efficiency. Strong competences in both accounting and financial management are needed to understand the interplay between firms, investors, and other stakeholders in a continuously changing society. Our programme stands out by providing these competences. Built upon a strong research base the program is balanced between the subjects financial accounting, management accounting and financial management.

Financial accounting courses involve measurement and disclosure issues facing enterprises in their financial reporting, and the impact of these issues on financial statement users. Management accounting courses focus on the design and use of management control systems from both a strategic and business process perspective, and they incorporate state-of-the-art information technology solutions for performance management, decision-making, planning, and control. Financial management courses focus on long-term decision making with respect to investments, financing, and risk management.

**Opportunities for interaction and engagement**

Through lectures and group work-assignments, you will train your skills in oral and written communication, analytical problem solving, project management and teamwork.

Throughout the programme, you will have ample opportunities to engage with industry and surrounding society. We frequently have guest lectures, some of which provide an organizational perspective and discussions on how theory can relate to unique situations, and others that address the background, trends, and general developments in the field. Further interaction with industry is facilitated trough our internship course, possible thesis collaborations and the many events organized by the school and the school’s student union.

Contemporary developments in sustainability and digitalisation affect current accounting and financial management practices, and our programme continuously scrutinises these ongoing challenges and interactions, and provides you opportunities to engage with them.

**International**

An international atmosphere allows you to experience other cultures, improve your communication skills, and build a global network of friends. You will be part of a multicultural classroom. You also have great opportunities to go on an exchange semester through the school’s many exchange agreements with partner universities around the world. More information about possibilities to study abroad can be found under Exchange opportunities.

## Programme structure and content

The programme extends over four semesters of full-time study. During semesters one and two, you take common core courses in accounting and financial management. During the third semester, you choose a number of elective courses within your area of interest. You can specialise within the field of accounting and financial management or broaden your skills with elective courses from other programmes. The third semester can also be spent at one of the school’s many partner universities, or at an external organization as part of our internship course. In the fourth semester, you will write a master's thesis.During the programme, you will be responsible for advanced work assignments and will learn through lectures, seminars, cases, and guest presentations.
