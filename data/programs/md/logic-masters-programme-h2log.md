## Summary

This statement is false; or is it? What makes a paradox paradoxical but a mathematical proof acceptable? What does it mean for a program to be bug-free? Logic is the study of all these questions, and of reasoning in general.

You will be prepared to follow both academic career paths and employment in a diverse array of fields, including software engineering and computational linguistics. You will participate in interdisciplinary collaboration within a dynamic research community.

## About

Do you see yourself thriving in an environment that fuses striking mathematical methodology and profound philosophical insights?  Logic has developed beyond the traditional definition as the study of formal aspects of valid reasoning to be more widely applicable not only in the neighbouring disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, and computer science, but also in industry and engineering. As a student of the programme, you will get a thorough education in the core topics in logic and will have the opportunity to explore applications in diverse areas including natural language processing, database design, and artificial intelligence. Although the programme is in this sense multidisciplinary, the core components are in mathematical logic.

### Unique interdisciplinary opportunities

The University of Gothenburg is one of only a few universities that offer a Master's programme that embraces the multifaceted interdisciplinary components of logic, and these substantial interdisciplinary possibilities are unique within Sweden. You will be exposed to the various ways research and education in mathematical logic is linked to philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. Recommended course packages include courses taught at partner departments, such as Mathematics and Computer Science and Engineering, and from our own Department of Philosophy, Linguistics, and Theory of Science.

### Emphasis on current research and collaboration

Our teachers are active researchers, and many are internationally recognized, well-established authorities within their sub-disciplines. The elective courses you will choose from are designed with the specializations of the involved teachers in mind, making the connection with research very explicit. The research seminar in Logic, a biweekly series with a high level of international guests, brings researchers and students together for discussions about logic. There is a close relationship between teachers, students, and the dynamic research environment.

### A rich academic experience

The Master's programme in Logic is two years of full-time study with a balanced combination of rigor and flexibility. You can expect a significant amount of hands-on, instructor-led skills training in addition to the theoretical lectures and seminars, computer laboratory work, and possibilities to individualize your study path. You will learn about the core areas of mathematical logic, including model theory, addressing the relationship between language and the objects that language describes; computability theory, investigating algorithms and the complexity of computational problems; proof theory, focusing on the structure of mathematical proofs and what it takes to prove the consistency of different theories; set theory, the general abstract study of one of the most fundamental concepts of mathematics and other formal sciences.

Find more information in the [programme syllabus](https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2021-10/H2LOG_programme_syllabus.pdf) or at the [Canvas activity](https://canvas.gu.se/courses/45028/assignments/syllabus).

## Programme structure and content

The programme begins with an in-depth introductory course specifically designed to give students from diverse backgrounds the foundational knowledge needed. There are six mandatory courses providing core knowledge:

- Logical Theory
- Set Theory
- Modal Logic
- Philosophy of Logic
- Proof Theory
- Model theory

There are several opportunities to tailor your education with elective courses, chosen from a range of subjects in applied or theoretical logic. Recent elective course offerings include: Category theory, Philosophy of mathematics, Axiomatic theories of truth, Models of computation, History of logic, Human reasoning and cognitive science, Lambda calculus and type theory, Quantified modal logic, Dependence logic, Provability logic, Decision theory, and Logic, games and automata.

You’re also encouraged to choose elective courses taught at partner departments. You will receive guidance to help build a profile matching your individual plans for your future career. Seminars, peer review, and supervising will assist you in writing your thesis, which is an in-depth exploration of a topic of your choice.

## Who should apply?

Are you a mathematician interested in philosophical questions like: What is a proof? Can we be sure mathematics is true?

Are you a philosopher or linguist with an aptitude for mathematical thinking and interest in formal systems for modelling arguments and natural languages?

Are you a computer scientist who wants to explore foundational questions or to apply logic in artificial intelligence applications, automated systems for knowledge, or web technologies?

Whether your educational background is specialized or interdisciplinary, if you have the courage to follow your curiosity, apply to the Master's programme in Logic today.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the programme requires, besides fulfilling basic entry requirements, successful completion of at least 60 credits in total in the subject areas mathematics, logic, computer science or formal linguistics, or at least 90 credits in philosophy or linguistics, and additionally, or as part of the 90 credits, at least 30 credits in total in the subject areas mathematics, logic, computer science or formal linguistics, or equivalent knowledge.

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6 / English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

Fill in the programme-specific _Application summary sheet_ and submit it along with the rest of your supporting documents.

Download the Application Summary Sheet:

### Selection

The selection is based on (i) a Personal Letter, and (ii) grades from previous relevant higher education. The Personal Letter should explain clearly the motivation for choosing this programme. The letter should introduce the the applicant both professionally and personally. The document must be entirely unique, i.e., it must not contain parts copied from any other source (with the exception of explicit quotations). Upload your personal letter to [www.universityadmissions.se](https://www.universityadmissions.se) before the admission round deadline.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Arts with a major in Logic.

The versatility of the master’s programme in Logic prepares you to follow both academic career paths and employment in a diverse array of fields.

Graduates with a degree in logic report jobs as consultants, software engineers, programmers, and teachers, along with a significant amount who continue with PhD programmes in Logic, Theoretical Philosophy, Linguistics, and Computer Science nationally and worldwide. Our extensive research connections provide research-oriented students ample occasions to network and further their post-graduate opportunities.
