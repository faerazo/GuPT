## Summary

A programme for musicians with a background in one of the world's traditional, folk music and world music genres. You may also be active within non-Western art music, such as classical Arabic or Indian music, or hybrid forms of these. The programme is taught in English. You should be open-minded and curious about the diversity of genres and experiences that exists in contemporary life. An important element consists of learning how to address and understand other musical expressions and traditions through ensemble playing and various projects.

## About

_This bachelor's programme was previously called Bachelor's Programme in Music, with a specialization in World Music Performance. The content of the programme is the same but with a new name._

You choose the specialisation of your individual musical immersion. You can also choose among several specialisation courses that will help you create the tools you need to work as a freelance musician. During three years, you will participate in collaborations with students from other courses at the Academy of Music and Drama.

### What is included in the programme?

**Main instrument and ensemble performance**

You will immerse yourself artistically in your main instrument by working individually as well as in ensemble. You have good opportunities to influence the direction of the curriculum. In the course Ensemble Performance, you encounter a range of musical traditions, which also contributes to the development of your own musical language. The emphasis is on interaction and active listening, and on the skills of playing in an ensemble, with dynamics, rhythm and communication. Courses in ergonomics are also included. You carry out a degree project during third year (15 HEC) in which you investigate a chosen question/issue through your musical practice. In this project you learn more about critical attitudes and the fundamental principles of artistic and practice-based research.

**Artistic Theory and Practice**

These courses provide theoretical perspectives on music theory, music technology, the history of music, music and society and the freelancers' world. In the practical parts of the courses, you complete a number of ensemble projects and work placement projects that offer new perspectives on the role of the freelance artist. Courses in ear training and scenic communication are also included. Knowledge of the freelance musician's job market is emphasized, the role of music in society is examined from scientific and artistic perspectives, and the music of different cultures is compared.

**Personal profile and projects**

You have an opportunity to choose elective courses to further deepen and broaden your knowledge in various subject areas. The programme prepares you for working as a freelance musician, including taking responsibility for planning, booking and marketing tours and concerts. The programme includes collaboration with Kulturförvaltningen Västra Götalandsregionen, Mölndals Kulturskola, World Sessions, Musikens hus i Göteborg och Planetafestivalen.

The programme also provides an opportunity to collaborate with other students. Music, poetry and acting are allowed to mix and create new expressions.

**On tour**

At least once a year, you and your class create a tour or concert. During the first year, you create a performance for children in primary school. In the second and third year, you head out on tour for a week. These projects aim to practice the professional life as a freelancer and practice aspects of planning, rehearsal, booking and execution.

### Teachers

The programme has an established team of teachers, who all have a solid knowledge within their field: Ahmad al Khatib, Mia Marine, Jonas Simonson, Stefan Bergman, Ingrid Brännström, Helge Andreas Norbakken and Sofia Högstadius. In addition to the main teachers, instrument teachers and regular visits by guest teachers are offered.
