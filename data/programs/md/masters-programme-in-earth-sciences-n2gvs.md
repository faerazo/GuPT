## Summary

The Master’s Programme in Earth Sciences offers a specialized education in geology or climatology/physical geography, allowing you to create your own unique profile according to your interests and goals. The courses offered provide various combinations of subject specialization, preparing you to address pressing questions in modern society concerning climate adaptation, environmental protection and the development of sustainable energy systems.

## About

The programme offers an in-depth and up-to-date understanding of crucial topics related to sustainable Earth Sciences. It is interdisciplinary in its foundation, strongly grounded in natural sciences and taking advantage of modern technology and instrumentation.

### Specialization

The programme consists of two areas of study: geology and climatology/physical geography. You can focus entirely within one area of interest or study courses in both subjects.

**Specialization: geology**

We offer a three week geology field trip each academic year, such as to the Alps or Oman. You will also have field-work opportunities in Sweden and greater Scandinavia, as well as internship possibilities. These field sites can be incorporated into a thesis project. When back in the Department, geology students, both in courses and project work, are directly connected to our research and labs in the department.

**Specialization: physical geography/climatology**

Many research projects are completed at the research infrastructure [Skogaryd Research Catchment](https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences/skogaryd-research-catchment-0)\- one of Sweden’s nationally supported field stations. Others are completed at the Latnjajaure Field Station, located in Northern Sweden, where the University of Gothenburg has conducted climate research since 1990.

### Thesis project

Our programme includes an extensive thesis project of at least 30 credits (one entire term), but preferably a 45 or 60 credit thesis. It constitutes the main part of your master's training and will deepen you knowledge in scientific work, analysis and reporting of scientific results. You will also advance your communication skills through presentations of scientific findings. The courses you choose, whether it be a field trip, lab course or seminar, will ultimately contribute to your thesis project work.

[Master's in Earth Sciences: Programme Structure and Content](https://www.gu.se/studera/hitta-utbildning/masters-in-earth-sciences-programme-structure-and-content)

### Earth Science Seminar - the core of the programme

This course brings together all students participating in the Earth Sciences Master’s Programme. Through the seminar, you are introduced to the programme, meet research and teaching staff, learn about job and PhD possibilities and, when applicable, present your own thesis work progress to others for feedback and support. The thesis project acts as a common thread, allowing you to generate ideas for your course selection and project idea. The seminar also serves as an important function for communication and creating community.

### Teaching and research environment

The teaching environment is characterized by close teacher - student contact, strong research connections, and close collaboration with the geoscience sector. This is your starting point for generating ideas and data for your thesis project. Our diverse community with links to wider, international research groups and field areas can be advantageous for you.

One of the benefits for students is the extensive opportunities to focus on issues of sustainability, with many of our climate studies involving climate modelling to explain and predict climate change. We study climate change via biochemistry, dendrology and atmosphere, allowing you to look at climate change through a range of proxies, depending upon personal interest.

Our strong research environment and advanced lab equipment in the field of geology correspond to the green energy needs of modern society. This will also be of benefit to you as a Master student and challenge your knowledge.

[Read more about our strong research areas, research groups and projects on our web site.](https://www.gu.se/en/earth-sciences/our-research)

## Who should apply?

- Have you studied geology, physical geography, or climatology and want to improve your skills?

- Is your career aimed at supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals in the areas of climate action, sustainable cities, green energy and resource distribution?

- Do you want to build a skillset in GIS and/or Remote Sensing tools, gaining cutting edge in-demand expertise?


## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the N2GVS Master's Programme in Earth Sciences, requires a university or college degree consisting of at least 180 credits, with at least 120 credits within Earth Sciences. Applicants with equivalent education may be admitted to the programme after review and approval.

International applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

Other entry requirements are documented in the respective syllabus.

### Assessment of qualifications

### Application and admission

If your application leads to an admission, you will be contacted by academic counselling for your course selection for your first fall term. Academic counselling can support you with your choices. You have guaranteed placement to all elective courses offered by our departmen (coursecodes start with: GVG-, MP-, GVN-, GVK-).

### Course plan

Once admitted to the programme, you will create a course plan in conjunction with the programme leadership and study counsellor.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

This educational programme gives you the modern tools required for working with advanced Earth Science applications within government and industry, as well as preparing you for a possible continuation of your academic career.

**Examples of working areas for previous Master students are:**

- national and international companies
- governmental agencies
- institutes
- other organisations dealing with natural resource and environmental management, such as consultants and companies within the energy-, insurance- and construction sectors

## Facilities

You will use our modern facilities actively during your education. Our labs include:

- Laser lab (Laser ICP-MS and SEM)
- Raman microscope
- Ice lab (proxy for rock mechanics)
- Dendrology lab
- Biogeochemistry lab (soil science)
- Volatile organic compounds (coupled to hydrogeology)

## Exchange opportunities

Did you know that as a degree-seeking student you study abroad? You can study at one of our partner universities around the world and get your credits recognized within your degree from the University of Gothenburg. You also have opportunities for an internship at a company or organization abroad. There are many opportunities. You can receive a placement at an EU institution, conduct field studies in a developing country (Minor Field Studies), or receive an Erasmus placement at a company or an organization.
