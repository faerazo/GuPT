## Summary

The programme is for those who are interested in health and public health. Our programme provides students with the skills you need to work strategically and practically with public health, both nationally and internationally. You will learn the individual and structural factors that impact health and what conditions ensure individuals have good health and health equality. After completing the programme, you will have a range of career opportunities and can continue on to doctoral studies. Welcome to apply!

## About

**Are you interested in health and improving public health? Do you want to make a difference and are driven by the idea of ensuring health equality? Then you should apply to the Master’s Programme in Public Health Science. Our students are trained to be able to work with public health, both nationally and internationally. We offer an international study environment where you will meet other students from around the world.**

Why are there such large differences in health among different groups of people? What are the relevant factors that influence health and how can we improve the lives of people? These are some of the public health challenges we are facing. A wide-ranging and interdisciplinary perspective is needed to reduce difference between groups and achieve long-term and equitable improvements to public health. There is a need for trained public health scientists to study these issues and to formulate and evaluate public health efforts.

The Master’s Programme in Public Health Science teaches students the central theories and methods of the field. This two-year programme is taught in English. The goal of the programme is to give you the tools needed to be able to plan, conduct and evaluate public health work and to work to reduce systematic differences in health in the population.

You will also learn about epidemiology, social epidemiology, quantitative and qualitative research methods and health economics theories and methods. We offer both an introductory and advanced course in health economics.

### Who can apply?

We encourage everyone to apply regardless of previous studies. Perhaps you have a background in health sciences, social sciences, natural sciences or the humanities? If you are looking for an interdisciplinary education, public health science is a subject for you.

### What we offer:

- International environment – meet teachers and students from around the world
- Mix of academic backgrounds – study with doctors, teachers, lawyers and other professions
- Introductory and advanced course in health economics
- Options for longer internships
- Opportunities for study and internships abroad
- Centrally located campus close to restaurants and entertainment
- A stone’s throw from Slottsskogen Park, the Botanical Garden and other green areas

## Programme structure and content

The Master’s Programme in Public Health Science focuses on student-centered learning. The students are expected to actively seek out knowledge, analyze and assess information outside of classroom activities. Most of our teaching and assessments emphasize academic discussion and critical thinking over memorization of facts.

Throughout your studies, you will have the opportunity to interact with public health professionals who will not only share their expertise but also encourage you to reflect on information and data. This synthesis of knowledge occurs both individually and collaboratively within diverse groups.

Our teaching combines lectures, group work, seminars, practical work and data analysis. You will be assessed in various ways, including written assessments and oral presentations both individually and in groups. Success will require that you are highly proficient in spoken and written English, as well the ability to actively participate in learning activities on-campus.

By choosing one of our elective internship courses, you will also gain insights into working as a public health professional and prepare yourself for a future career.
