## Summary

Software engineers and software managers will have a key role in all aspects of society, from using AI to provide customer service and financial advice, to developing self-driving cars, to creating apps in the health and biotech sphere. We are among the largest software engineering groups in the world, and our researchers have worldwide impact. Our programme gives you the opportunity to complete collaborative projects, work with partners in industry, and participate in hackathons, gaining the skills necessary to improve the world with software.

## About

The development of software and smart, efficient information technology solutions is changing the way we live our lives. From developing self-driving cars to smart devices and social media, people who have the skills to create innovative products utilizing technology and management are increasingly in demand. The bachelor’s programme in Software Engineering and Management will develop your social, technical, and management skills, all important for a successful career in any domain. You will practice working in teams to gain experience in various roles important to your future career and to gain an understanding of the strength of a cohesive team.

### A well-rounded, collaborative, project-based education

The programme addresses methods and techniques for developing software, asking the right questions to customers, translating customer answers into design, and managing projects, organizations, and development teams. You will develop technical skills, the capability to analyse problems, the ability to estimate time and cost for development projects, and the capacity to communicate and interact with customers and other partners in software development projects. A strength of our programme compared to others is the dual focus on software engineering and management skills.

The programme has a tight relationship to the software industry, which is an important aspect of the programme. Within the courses and projects, we collaborate with practitioners from industry and you are introduced to realistic problems experienced in the software industry through guest lecturers and supervisors from industry. A key element of the curriculum is the focus on problem-based and project-based learning. You will work on broad and complex problem definitions and learn to structure and solve them.

[Collaboration with software companies an important part of the education](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/collaboration-with-software-companies-an-important-part-of-the-education)

### Preparing you for a successful career

You will be trained to take responsibility for your learning, and the teachers, supervisors, and the educational environment are all resources in this process. The programme is open to students from around the world, and we embrace the influence of this international group of students. We take pride in standing out among other bachelor’s programmes by offering ours completely in English, and our international environment—with teachers and students from all over the world—will prepare you for master’s studies in various fields or a career in industry, in Sweden or internationally.
