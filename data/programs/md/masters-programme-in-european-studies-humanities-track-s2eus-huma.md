## Summary

Europe is changing, and so are the ways Europeans understand themselves, their societies and the world they live in. Crucial issues concern European identity, how unity can be reconciled with diversity and what it means to see oneself as a European. In this programme, you study Europe from a humanistic perspective, based on the basic belief that humanists must be involved in shaping the path of the future.

## About

You will learn to critically examine and understand Europe as an idea and community, but also how Europe has been influenced by national and cultural identities. We shed light on European self-understanding in relation to other parts of the world, both historically and in present-day globalization. You will develop your skills in critical analysis, text interpretation, analysing cultural practices,  application of scientific methods, and preparing your own arguments.

As a student, you will be part of the multi-disciplinary milieu Centre for European Studies (CES) in close collaboration with the Centre for European Research ( [CERGU](https://www.gu.se/en/european-research)). We offer you a unique possibility to combine historic and theoretical knowledge with social and political perspectives on contemporary challenges in Europe.

## Programme structure and content

**The first semester** consists of three mandatory courses:

- European Heritage and Identity
- European Borderlands
- Political and Public Spheres and Spaces in European History and Culture

**In the second semester**, you can choose elective courses in Sweden or abroad, or do an internship for a half or a full semester.

**In the third semester**, you first choose one of the following semi-elective courses:

- Social Europe
- European Environment
- Energy or Europe in the World

Secondly **,** you choose one of the four methods courses:

- Applied Statistical Analysis,
- Applied Qualitative Research Methods,
- Applied Qualitative Research Methods, Problems and Design,
- Introduction to Applied Research Design and Quantitative Research Methods for Social Scientists


**The last semester** is dedicated to your Master’s thesis, with seminars and peer review to assist you, along with individual supervision.

• Develop your knowledge to critically analyse and understand Europe as an idea and society

[More information about facilities](https://www.gu.se/en/social-sciences/study-here/campus-haga)

## Exchange opportunities

In addition to personal development and an increased understanding of the outside world, studying abroad gives you a sharper resume with international experience. Students who have studied abroad have and continue to develop characteristics such as adaptability, the ability of initiative and ability to handle unexpected situations. In addition, you improve your language skills and gain an international network of friends for life!

During your studies, you have the opportunity to study one semester abroad. We co-operate with universities in several European countries, but also in the US and South Korea. Start planning your exchange studies early so you know when to go and when you need to apply.

[More information about exchange opportunities](https://studentportal.gu.se/en/go-international/exchange-studies?i_sk=1)

## Internship

You can do an internship, in Sweden or abroad, during the elective semester of the programme. Many students state that the internship is the best thing they have done! It provides new perspectives and prepares you for your future working-life. You will expand your network, which is important when you apply for work.

You choose and apply for an internship yourself, but it must be approved by the Department of Political Science. One of the requirements is that you will be offered qualified assignments that involve independent analytical work, where you can practice and develop what you have learned during your studies. Our students have had internships at international organisations such as the EU or UN, national agencies, local and regional authorities, within research projects and cultural organisations.
