## Summary

Crafting Futures is a pioneering education that trains students to work at the intersections of craft, fine art and design. The programme is based at Campus Steneby in Dalsland, a rural area known for its Swedish craft traditions. Students develop creative approaches that position craft as a means of exploring and critically engaging with materials, place and landscape. Students have access to specialist workshops and learn to work with a wide variety of materials and processes.

## About

This is a three-year, full-time Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) programme that is designed for students who are passionate about developing a practice that rests upon the exploration of materials and techniques. You'll learn in a small group setting, and all our teaching is in English. This mean’s you’ll be part of a diverse group exchanging ideas and learning together through making. Aside from practical workshops, Crafting Futrues also includes lectures and discussions that explore how making can structure our relationships in human and natural ecologies.

We'll guide you in managing projects from the initial idea to the final result. This will help you gain knowledge in often overlooked crafts like working with paper, natural fibers, leather, wax, and recycled materials. By taking an interdisciplinary approach, you might also experiment with new techniques in an area you're already familiar with. We'll teach you how to write about your work and develop strategies to turn your passion into a career.

### Programme structure and content

In the first year, you'll try out a wide range of materials and techniques, laying the foundation for a diverse craft practice. You will get familiar with our workshops and learn to create using different tools and methods. You will also start exploring how materials connect with the surrounding landscape. The first year focuses on trying new methods and materials, boosting your creativity, and considering how you want to specialize later in the program. You will also take courses together with students in Furniture Design and Metal Art. In Craft and Design Histories and Futures, you will learn about historical and emerging practices and how to investigate relevant topics for your practice. Core Skills classes introduce sketching techniques, project planning, and how to document your work.

During the second year, you will be guided in how to specialize. In the Autumn term, you'll learn in-depth about a traditional craft of your choice from practical and theoretical perspectives, and see how it can be adapted to new contexts. During the Spring, you will undertake an in-depth exploration of making practices in relation to a place and its ecology. Alternatively, you could join an international study exchange with a partner university. You'll also learn to communicate your work through writing, exhibitions, and social media. Second-year students can choose optional courses that match their interests.

In the third year, we'll help you align your interests with professional practice and prepare you to work independently. You'll have the chance to participate in work placements and receive career guidance before starting an independent exam project and showcasing your work in our graduation exhibition.

A BFA in Crafting Futures opens various professional practice opportunities grounded in material knowledge.

After graduation, you can apply for a Master's programme in craft, art, design, or teaching, where you can further develop your specialization.

## Facilities

We have custom-built workshops for Crafting Futures, including a modeling workshop for wood and metal, extensive textile facilities, wet modeling in clay and plaster, and a 3D digital lab. You’ll also have the possibility to access our larger metal and wood workshops. Depending on what you want to develop, you might need to find or build some of your own tools and equipment.
