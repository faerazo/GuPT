## Summary

The International Master’s programme in Educational Research prepares you to become an active educational researcher or to gain a scholarly foundation for your current professional practice. You will learn in a research-intensive community, addressing the full spectrum of research skills and possibilities. It will also prepare you to successfully contribute to the future of educational studies through research, practice, or policy recommendations.

## About

With education consistently part of public discourse and debate, there is increasing demand for educational research, which can influence everything from good customer service, to improving gender equality in schools, to changing policy, to understanding sustainability challenges. The International Master’s programme in Educational Research (IMER) enables you to study research in education as an academic discipline. Some students join the programme in pursuit of subsequent doctoral research, while others join as qualified teachers or professionals aiming to give their professional practice a more scholarly footing.

**A research-intensive programme**

IMER is distinguished from other educational master’s programmes by its deep focus on research. You will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of educational research, including critical and empirical analyses of educational institutions, processes, and management. Throughout the programme, you will come in contact with research-active academics. Your individual interests will drive your educational path in our programme, and you will gain experience working independently and learning to successfully manage your time and work. Throughout the programme, your teachers will be available for advice and scholarly discussions.

**An international and collaborative learning environment**

You will join a small but vibrant international group of students. No more than thirty new students can join the programme each year. We strive for international diversity in both our students and academic staff, with tutors coming from Australia, China, England, Ethiopia, Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands in addition to Sweden. This diverse international teaching and research experience influences the teaching and interactions and creates a strong learning environment of team commitment. Furthermore, we encourage interdisciplinarity in our programme and welcome students from various academic backgrounds.

Our goal is to embrace as many perspectives as possible in order to build a rich research tradition and broad yet distinctive research discipline.

## Programme structure and content

You will discover educational research traditions and methods while actively exploring your own unfolding identity as an educational researcher through lectures, seminars, and interactions with the literature, classmates, tutors, and researchers. You will gain an understanding of ethical principles and approaches in doing research and how different choices affect the participants and context. This research-intensive programme prepares you to critically, independently, and creatively pursue the research process, including professionally writing and reporting educational research, culminating in your master’s thesis. IMER consists of seven mandatory courses:

• Introduction to International Master in Educational Research

• Introduction to Educational Research Practice

• Qualitative Approaches to Educational Research

• Design, Measurement and Analysis in Educational Research

• Academic Reading in Education

• Academic Writing and Research Design

• Master’s Thesis in Education

## Who should apply?

Are you an education professional wanting to learn how to do research in educational settings? Are you a working teacher wanting to better grasp the place of research in teaching and learning? Do you want to become a practicing educational scholar or researcher who utilizes research theories, methods, and practices in an educational context?

If you already have a fair understanding of what education is and how teaching and learning are done, and you want to discover the ‘world of research’ behind educational practice, apply for the International Master’s programme in Educational Research.

In the A building you will find the Service Center, the University Library, the Student Union's office, study counselling, the International Student Office Pedagogen and a café.
