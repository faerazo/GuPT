## About

In every society, craft provide vital reference points, helping us shape the future while grounding us in the present. Craft link human needs and activities across history creating a dynamic artistic field that engages with both cultural heritage and contemporary practice. At HDK-Valand, the master’s programme in Craft forms part of a vibrant academic environment where undergraduate education, research, and societal engagement are constantly in dialogue.

### The master’s programme in Craft offers three specialisations:

- Jewellery Art

- Ceramic Art

- Textile Art


Each specialisation provides a unique opportunity to delve into artistic exploration and conceptual development through materials. The programme is designed to cultivate your ability to initiate and realise artistic projects, encouraging independent thinking, critical analysis, and technical mastery.

### Collaborative Work Environment and Individual Development

You will work alongside students from other specialisations, with a focus on your chosen field—be it jewellery art, ceramic art, or textile art. The small study groups and close contact with experienced teachers create an environment that fosters collaboration and intensive learning. This setting allows you to develop confidence in your working methods, broaden your artistic perspective, and enhance both technical and theoretical knowledge. Each student is provided with an individual workspace and generous access to our state-of-the-art facilities.

### Shaping Your Artistic Expression

The programme seamlessly integrates theory, reflection, and practice, with a focus on nurturing your individual artistic voice. Through studio work, lectures, seminars, and supervision, you will shape your artistic expression and engage deeply with materials and concepts. The programme encourages the development of skill-based knowledge, fosters debate about material inquiries, and investigates the conceptual identity of craft.

### Specialising in Ceramic Art

The ceramic department holds light and beautiful workshops, several electrical kilns, and three combined electrical and gas kilns. We have plaster, casting, and glazing workshops.

Our small study groups and close contact with experienced, internationally recognised teachers create an intensive learning environment that fosters collaboration and personal growth. The programme integrates theory, reflection, and practice, supporting the development of your individual artistic voice.

### Join a Dynamic Research Environment

At HDK-Valand, you’ll be part of a thriving research community that spans from undergraduate to doctoral level. Our programme offers unique opportunities to engage with cutting-edge, practice-based research, broadening your understanding of your own artistic practice and its relevance in the contemporary art world. While you may not work directly on specific research projects, you’ll have the chance to attend research seminars, interact with doctoral students, and gain insight into innovative methods that push the boundaries of craft as an art form. This environment also provides a strong foundation for those considering PhD studies in artistic practice
