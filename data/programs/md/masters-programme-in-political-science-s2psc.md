## Summary

This state-of-the-art programme prepares you for a professional career in global and domestic politics, public administration, or civil society, with advanced analysis of politics and society as a central element. Our internationally prominent research groups focus on quality of government and corruption, democracy and democratization, social dilemmas and environmental politics, and electoral studies and public opinion.

## About

### Double degree option

In addition to studying Master's Programme in Political Science in Gothenburg there is one double degree option that you can apply to. See the link below for further information and instructions on how to apply.

[Double Degree Track, University of Konstanz, Germany](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/masters-programme-in-political-science-double-degree-option-with-university-of-konstanz)

### Master's Programme in Political Science

Quality of government. Citizens, politicians, and the media. Varieties of democracy. Institutional responses to environmental problems. Performance of democracies. These are all areas where you can compete for a career within global and domestic politics, public administration, and civil society. The Master's Programme in Political Science (MaPS) prepares you for this.

### Tailor your education to your interests and goals

A core mandatory course familiarizes you with research in comparative politics, public administration, political behavior, political theory, and international relations. The course guides you from research classics to current research, and has problem-based research assignments that enable you to improve your skills in critically reflected oral and written academic presentations. With this foundation, you then choose from our in-depth elective courses, which rely on strong research profiles in our department. This means that you can develop your academic skills with the help of dedicated professors who are prominent researchers within their fields. You can choose among the following in-depth courses:

- The Quality of Government in a Comparative Perspective

- Citizens, Politicians, and the Media: Evaluating Democratic Processes
- Environmental Politics and Institutions

- Varieties of Democracy and Democratization

- The Performance of Democracies


### Specialize in your choice of research methods

We offer highly qualified studies in research methods, including the opportunity to specialize through a selection of four courses:

- Applied Statistical Analysis

- Applied Qualitative Research Methods

- Applied Qualitative Research Methods, problems and design

- Introduction to Applied Research Design and Quantitative Research Methods for Social Scientists


Taking one methods course is mandatory, but you can choose to take two. This opportunity provides additional preparation for the job market, where exceptional skills in research methods are as relevant for careers within public policy as the monitoring of political power.

## Programme structure and content

**The first semester** provides advanced knowledge of main research areas within contemporary political science and gives you the opportunity to choose between four research methods courses.

**The second semester** has in-depth research-oriented courses you can choose from, in areas such as quality of government and corruption, electoral studies and public opinion, social dilemmas and environmental politics, and democracy and democratization.

**The third semester** offers a number of different alternatives. You may do an internship for either a half or a full semester, take in-depth courses in political science or additional research methods, or you can choose to study abroad.

**The final semester** concerns your master’s thesis project. You will independently develop and apply the theoretical and methodological knowledge and skills gained throughout the programme. Researchers with an international reputation in their field and with solid experience of guiding research projects are available as advisors.

## Who should apply?

Do you aim for a career within global and domestic politics, public administration, or civil society? Would you like to come well prepared? Our programme has an ambitious group of students from many different countries. You will meet teachers dedicated to an academically solid and career-preparatory education. We value ambition and expect the highest level of academic integrity. You also benefit from our expectations for your capacity to obtain knowledge and to develop your analytic skills. The degree also qualifies you to apply for doctoral studies in political science.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree and at least 60 credits in political science or equivalent skills. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Special instructions for application

Please note that your application should include a Statement of Intent and a written assignment that you have completed individually during your previous education.

[More information about\\
Special instructions for application](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/application-for-the-masters-programme-in-political-science-maps)

### Selection

The selection is based on the submitted Statement of intent (use the assigned form) and written assignment. These shall be uploaded on [www.universityadmissions.se](https://www.universityadmissions.se) no later than February 3  (if you apply in the first admission round) and May 2 (if you apply in the second admission round).

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Science in Political Science.

You will be prepared for a professional career with advanced analysis of politics and society as a central element. Political scientists typically work within the field of research and investigation, power monitoring, public opinion formation, public administration, or politics. You will also be qualified to apply for doctoral studies in political science. Examples of the professions among our previous students are diplomat, political advisor, public official, project manager, and analyst.

## Facilities

The Department is located in Campus Haga, which lies right in the centre of the city of Gothenburg.

[More information about facilities](https://www.gu.se/en/social-sciences/study-here/campus-haga)

## Exchange opportunities

Students who have studied abroad have and continue to develop characteristics such as adaptability, the ability of initiative and ability to handle unexpected situations. In addition, you improve your language skills and gain an international network of friends for life! During your studies, you have the opportunity to study one or two semesters abroad. We co-operate with universities in countries such as the Netherlands, the USA and South Korea. Start planning your exchange studies early so you know when to go and when you need to apply.

[More information about exchange opportunities](https://studentportal.gu.se/en/go-international/exchange-studies?i_sk=1)

## Internship

You can do an internship, in Sweden or abroad, during the elective semester of the programme. Many students state that the internship is the best thing they have done during their studies! It provides new perspectives and prepares you for your future working life. You also get the chance to network, which has proven to be important when looking for jobs.

You choose and apply for an internship yourself, but it must be approved by the Department of Political Science. One of the requirements is that you can be offered qualified assignments that involve independent analytical work, where you develop what you have learned during your studies. Examples of common internship organisations are embassies, authorities, consultancy agencies and international organisations such as the EU and the UN.
