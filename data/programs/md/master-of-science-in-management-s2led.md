## Summary

Ready to enhance your leadership skills and drive sustainable change? Join our Master’s programme in Management. Benefit from cutting-edge research, immersive simulations, and interactions with our corporate partners. Experience the vibrant city of Gothenburg through local excursions and events. Empower yourself to make a difference. Become a part of our journey to develop reflexive leaders for a better tomorrow.

## About

_“I will hire future leaders that can understand and critically analyze complex texts and relations – the simple things I will have AI solutions for”_(CEO corporate partners)

In today's fast-paced world, the demand for leaders of integrity who foster dialogue and embrace diversity is critical. We need reflexive leaders who think strategically, drive change, and tackle global challenges like inequality and climate change. Our Master's programme is dedicated to foster these leaders and empower them to shape a better future.

Our programme prepares you for leadership roles and strategic responsibilities. Emphasizing your impact on sustainable development, we equip you with crucial tools in strategy, leadership, change management, and decision-making. Upon completion, you'll confidently address management complexities and drive strategic endeavors, guided by a solid inner compass.

### Beyond the traditional classroom

Our lecturers are actively engaged both within and outside the university. This ensures that the programme is grounded in the latest research and that your coursework reflects the most current perspectives. While a robust academic foundation is fundamental for cultivating critical thinking, navigating complex situations, and embracing diverse perspectives, becoming a reflexive leader however requires more than just academic prowess. To complement your academic learning, we therefore facilitate in-depth discussions with corporate guests, participation in case competitions, and immersive experiences with business simulation games.

Beyond traditional academic avenues, we encourage exploration of contemporary art, film, and music as research underscores the significance of such explorations in developing vital skills like courage, self-awareness, empathy, and creativity. We believe that a well-rounded approach, encompassing both academic and experiential dimensions, is crucial in shaping leaders who can navigate the complexities of the real world.

### Leaders that matter

From the outset, our programme actively applies theories of leadership, strategy, and management to address society's most urgent social and environmental challenges. Sustainability is not merely an addition but is woven into the fabric of our curriculum, eliminating the need for isolated 'sustainability courses.' Our daily commitment is geared towards transforming you not only into being reflexive leaders, but into leaders dedicated to creating a better future.

Throughout the programme, we delve into the impact of macro-trends such as sustainability, digitalisation, and globalisation on your approach to leading companies and organizations. We purposefully challenge your ethical beliefs, prompting thoughtful consideration of the trade-offs and ethical dilemmas inherent in future leadership roles.

In essence, our dedication is unwavering – we are here to guide you on the path to becoming a leader who truly matters.

### International

Reflexive leaders embody an inclusive mindset and possess intercultural competence crucial for establishing trusting relationships. Within our international atmosphere, you can cultivate these skills by immersing yourself in diverse cultures within our multicultural classrooms, refining your communication abilities, and establishing a global network of friendships. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to spend an exchange semester at one of our renowned partner universities, further enriching your cross-cultural experiences.

## Programme structure and content
