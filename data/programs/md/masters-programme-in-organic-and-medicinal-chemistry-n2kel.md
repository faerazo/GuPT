## Summary

The Master’s Programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry provides you in-depth knowledge in the design and synthesis of substances that form the basis of new medicines and exciting new materials. Current research is incorporated into the teaching. You will have the opportunity to practise your learning and develop a specialization towards either organic chemistry or medicinal chemistry with the possibility to perform an individual laboratory-based project of up to one year in one of our research groups.

## About

Organic compounds constitute the foundation of various industries such as rubber, plastic, fuel, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, detergents, coating, dyestuff, and agrichemicals. The very foundations of biochemistry, biotechnology, and medicine consist of organic compounds and their role in life processes. Clearly, organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry are important to our high standard of living.

### An in-depth and well-rounded education

You will gain in-depth knowledge in the design and synthesis of substances that form the basis of exciting new materials or have specific effects on the body. You will also study organic chemical reactions, the principles for stereoselective synthesis, the use of catalysts, spectroscopy, and computational chemistry. Within the programme, you can direct your education towards either organic chemistry or medicinal chemistry. Your specialization will influence the topic of your final degree project.

### Teaching

Our programme emphasizes close contact with teachers and researchers, teaching in small groups and using problem-based learning methods in the form of mini projects. You will develop your critical and analytical thinking through project work and your communication skills through oral and written presentations of scientific material. You will put theory into practice during our many laboratory courses, allowing you to develop strong experimental skills. At the end of the programme, you will perform an individual degree project of one year within one of our top research groups.

All courses are taught in English.

### Why study Organic and Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Gothenburg?

1. Teaching in small groups and in close contact with your instructors

2. Problem-based learning and laboratory-intensive courses connected to ongoing research

3. The opportunity to tailor your education to your interests and create a unique profile.

Studying in Sweden has the added benefit of contributing to a more gender-equal field, with more equitable funding and opportunities for further education and employment.

### Top 75 worldwide in Life Sciences—Biological Sciences

In the field of Life Sciences—Biological Sciences, the University of Gothenburg ranks amongst the **top 3 universities in Sweden** and **top 75 worldwide** in the ShanghaiRanking 2024. Biological sciences include biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysics, cell biology, and microbiology.

### Scholarship - Pioneering Women in STEM

For the 2025 intake, a special scholarship is available exclusively **for women from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam**. The scholarship will be awarded to one admitted student who has good study results in her bachelor’s degree. [Read more about how to apply and what the scholarship covers on Swedish Institute's website.](https://si.se/en/apply/scholarships/pioneeringwomeninstem/)

## Programme structure and content

### First academic year, first semester

- Advanced Organic Chemistry (KEM815)

- Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (KEM825)

- Introduction to molecular modelling (KEM 552)


If you have already taken these courses, you are free to choose any other course taught at the University of Gothenburg.

### **First academic year, second semester**

- Advanced Organic Synthesis (KEM750)

- Advanced Medicinal Chemistry (KEM760)


These courses are mandatory.

### Second academic year

During the second academic year, you will perform an individual degree project within one of our top research groups, giving you the opportunity to specialize in the research area you are most interested in, being organic chemistry or medicinal chemistry.

## Who should apply?

Are you curious about the vast possibilities of chemical reactions?

Do you want to learn how to design and synthesize substances that form the basis of exciting new materials?

Are you interested in how certain substances have specific effects on the body?

If you want foundational knowledge about organic compounds and their role in life processes, apply for the Master’s Programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree in Science with a minimum of 90 credits in chemistry, including at least 22,5 credits in organic chemistry, or equal qualifications. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

The selection process is based on number of credits from previous university studies (maximum 165 credits), the applicants CV, letter of recommendation, and letter of motivation. Interviews are conducted if considered necessary in order to make a correct evaluation.

## After graduation
