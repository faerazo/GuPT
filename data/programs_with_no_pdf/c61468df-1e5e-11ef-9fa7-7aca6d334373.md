## Specialisations

## Purpose

The aim of the programme is to provide a foundational academic education within Craft with specialisation in Metal Art.

The program is designed for those who want to strengthen their artistic identity using metal as their primary material. The student develops a broad knowledge of metal and various techniques such as blacksmithing, fabrication, and casting. The meanings and possibilities of the local context in terms of craft practices, use of resources and sustainability are highlighted and problematised. The courses are directed towards diverse contexts with an exploratory, creative, and reflective approach. The students work in gallery, private and public spaces, showcasing their work and building their careers. The student learns to promote their artistic identity through digital media such as social media, video, and photo.

The program prepares the student for professional work in the artistic field of metal and equips them to meet contemporary and future challenges.

The program prepares for further studies at the second cycle.

## Entry requirements

Approved work sample. Exceptions may be made for Swedish when the language of instruction is English.


## Degree and main field of study

Degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Craft with Specialisation in Metal Art.

(Konstnärlig kandidatexamen i konsthantverk med inriktning Metallgestaltning)

## Content

The programme is divided into courses that are specific to Metal Art, courses that are common to all BFA programmes at Campus Steneby, and programme courses that are elective within the department.

- Programme-specific courses totaling 97,5 credits, including a Bachelor's degree project of 30 credits.
- Common courses totaling 67,5 credits
- Elective programme courses totaling 15 credits.

The curriculum is designed based on knowledge, skills and competence objectives, emphasising the student's development of an exploratory approach, self-directed learning, and self-assessment.

Presentation, documentation, and self-evaluation are considered important parts of the learning process. The responsibility of students for their own learning, and the search and evaluation of knowledge is emphasised. The progress of studies is monitored through semester reports, semester presentations, and individual development discussions.

During the first two years, studies are largely project-based, where technical, material, and functional requirements are related to design problems, various contexts, and sustainability. As students acquire new knowledge, skills, and approaches, progressively higher requirements are placed on analysis and depth, as well as planning and executing projects within given time frames.

The third year allows for internships, collaborative projects, and the completion of self-formulated exploratory projects.

**During the first semester** the studies are largely focused on training in technique and methodology, with an emphasis on artistic expression and an exploratory approach. Students are introduced to how historical perspectives can shape their own choices and how local resources can influence their design work.

**During the second semester** students develop their individual expression in relation to the craft context. Based on self-formulated questions, students conduct an exploratory project.

A common course on artistic processes and methods further develops skills in investigating, producing, and documenting artistic ideas. Historical and contemporary perspectives are further investigated, enabling students to work with future scenarios related to artistic craft practices.

**During the third semester** students take a common course on exhibition methodology, which includes both physical and digital presentation formats, as well as the development of an artistic portfolio.

Students will take an elective course that is offered by the department and which complements their programme specific learning.

In the programme-specific course, the design of space and place is explored concerning interaction, function, and the tradition of metal art.

**During the fourth semester**, students take a second elective course offered by the department.

In the programme-specfic courses students explore a context that offers ritual and the opportunity to remember. Students contribute objects that support the needs of the context. The ability to formulate their artistic questions and place them in a context with the help of references is practiced and deepened. By participating in an elective course, students broaden their competence.

**During the fifth semester**, students apply their skills in societal and professional contexts with a strong focus on work experience and collaboration. Students choose whether to undertake an internship or take the course Design and Craft in a Sociocultural Environment. Students who choose the internship course, are offered support in establishing contacts with suitable practices and organisations through an existing collaboration with Mötesplats Steneby, as well as through contacts made during study visits in previous semesters. Both options aim to further contribute to the knowledge needed in the development of practical and theoretical skills required for the thesis work undertaken during the sixth semester. At the end of semester five, students will have developed a project description for a Bachelor's thesis project.

**During the sixth semester**, students complete an in-depth artistic degree project within Metal Art. Students will also present their degree project in a public context. Upon completion of the course, students are expected to hold the skills required for continued independent work within their professional artistic field.

**About exchange studies**

During semesters 3 and 4, the programme welcomes incoming exchange students, subject to availability.

In semester 4, students in the programme have the opportunity to participate in exchange studies after applying to one of the department's partner universities.

**About elective programme courses within the department**

Educational programmes offered at the department include compulsory elective programme courses. These courses aim to offer complementary education in artistic practices in addition to the programmes' subject specialisations. The range of elective courses provides opportunities for the student to broaden their knowledge and develop their skills and abilities. Within the elective courses, students meet across department subjects. Students apply for the elective courses based on an annual course offering.
