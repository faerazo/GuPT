## Specialisations

## Purpose

The aim of the programme is to provide a foundational academic education within the field of Crafting Futures.

The BFA programme in Crafting Futures is a craft-led artistic education where students learn to develop a craft practice that bridges a variety of materials and media. By using the term craft-led the programme emphasise the way in which craftsmanship leads a knowledge creation that contributes to a broader discourse of contemporary artistic expressions and theories.

The programme is designed for those who want to develop artistic work focused on craftsmanship, material knowledge, and method. The courses within the programme are directed towards various artistic and social contexts where the approach is investigative, creative, and reflective. Emphasis is placed on how the choice of media, materials, and methods can position craft as co-creator of resilient ecologies.

With focus on the geographical position and rural identity of Campus Steneby, students form artistic methods that seek to preserve and develop local ecologies, places, and community environments – an educational effort that integrates _place_ as a resource in artistic practice.

The students examine the foundational components of an artistic craft practice where recurring and established concepts will be challenged in relation to current norms within the field of Craft. This includes material choices, methods as well as expected artistic results.

Upon completion of the programme, students have developed the ability to work with artistic craft methods that apply tools, processes, methods, and theories in an investigative manner, taking into account and contributing to the creation of community-oriented resilience.

Students are prepared for a wide range of professional activities in the arts, including innovation, cultural heritage, conservation, community development, studio crafts, and public art.

The programme prepares for further studies at second cycle.

## Content

The programme is divided into courses that are specific to Crafting Futures, courses that are common to all BFA programmes at Campus Steneby, and programme courses that are elective within the department.

- Programme-specific courses totaling 97,5 credits, including a Bachelor's degree project of 30 credits
- Common courses totaling 67,5 credits
- Elective programme courses totaling 15 credits.

**During the first semester**, students are introduced to the subject of Crafting Futures. The common courses bring together students from different artistic subjects working with situated place and local material resources. Students practice 3D sketching and artistic processes through analog and digital materials where photography is included as a tool for communication. The history and theory course train students in academic reading, writing, information retrieval, and participation in student debates about future professional roles and societal challenges related to the subject as well as define, document, and analyse a site-specific ecology related to craft or design.

The programme-specific course focus on training techniques and methods, with an emphasis on artistic expression and investigative approach.

Students receive a comprehensive introduction to the programme-specific workshop and through craft-led assignments begin to develop a practice that encompasses multiple media and materials. Work focuses on decoding concepts established in artistic craft processes, challenging their possibilities and limitations with the aim to broaden the field through artistic practice. This work is complemented by study visits to places that relate to, and challenge these concepts.

Seasonal thematics as a pedagogical tool allow for ongoing material processes related to programme-specific courses when students are engaged in co-reading, further relating _place_ as resource whilst training practical works and documentation techniques.

**During the second semester,** students receive an introduction to workshops specific to the other subject areas at Campus Steneby (Metal Art and Wood Oriented Furniture Design).

A common course on artistic processes and methods further develops skills in investigating, producing, and documenting artistic ideas. Historical and contemporary perspectives are further investigated in the second history and theory course, enabling students to work with future scenarios related to artistic craft practices.

In the programme-specific course the student continues their practical exploration through further questioning and defining of established concepts through the artistic craft practice. The seasonal thematic provides structure and continuity in the programme-specific learning throughout the semester.

**During the third semester**, students participate in a common course on exhibition methodology, which includes both physical and digital presentation formats, as well as the development of an artistic portfolio.

Students will take an elective course that is offered by the department and which complements their programme specific learning.

The programme-specific course emphasise awareness of the relationship to the world, contemporaneity, and history, with advanced training in relating craft practice to theory formation, materials, tools, and methods. Students explore how an investigative craft practice is shaped through the encounter between traditional and emerging practices, work that further enables speculative future scenarios.

**During the fourth semester**, students take a second elective course offered by the department.

In the programme-specific course, the work continues to define _place_ as a resource and tool. With focus on Campus Steneby’s local surroundings and collaborative exercises, the concept of resilisent eologies will be contextualised and challenged with a focus on rural contexts. Skills from previous courses are applied and discussed through presented results. This semester serves as a further transition towards the independent work to be developed in the third year.

**During the fifth semester**, students apply their skills in societal and professional contexts with a strong focus on work experience and collaboration. Students choose whether to undertake an internship or take the course _Design and Craft in a Sociocultural Environment._ Students who choose internship, are offered support in establishing contacts with suitable practices and organisations through an existing collaboration with Mötesplats Steneby, as well as through contacts made during study visits in previous semesters. Both options aim to further contribute to the knowledge needed in the development of practical and theoretical skills required for the thesis work undertaken during the sixth semester. At the end of semester five, students will have developed a project description for a Bachelor's degree project.

**During the sixth semester**, students complete an in-depth artistic degree project within Crafting Futures. Students are also expected to present their degree project in a public context. Upon completion of the course, students are expected to hold the skills required for continued independent work within their professional artistic field.

**About exchange studies**

During semesters 3 and 4, the programme welcomes incoming exchange students.

In semester 4, students in the programme have the opportunity to participate in exchange studies after applying to one of the department's partner universities.
