## About

This course provides the opportunity for in-depth study of metal art for those who have prior knowledge at the university level or equivalent work experience and who want to develop further in the field. This semester of full-time studies follows the syllabus of the second semester of the Bachelor’s programme in metal art.

During the semester, you will work in one of the largest academic metal workshops in the world as you deepen your knowledge of materials and techniques in metal and apply them to your own design work. Our 1200-square-meter forge provides ample opportunities to explore different techniques based on tasks and themes founded on the concepts material, body, and space. Through lectures, application exercises with supervision, workshops, and tutorials, you will receive support for further developing your working methods and also for reflecting on your work and communicating your choice of methods both in writing and orally. You will gain in-depth knowledge of visual design, including the study of theory.

You will study in an international and unique environment: HDK-Valand [Campus Steneby](https://www.gu.se/en/hdk-valand/about-us/campus-steneby-where-people-ideas-and-materials-meet) in Dals Långed, 170 kilometres north of Gothenburg.
