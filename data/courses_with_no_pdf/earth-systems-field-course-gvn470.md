## Summary

This course focuses on field training and developing your practical skills. You will go on a two-week field trip to a non-Nordic country and gain experience in sampling and measuring, for example, soils, landforms, vegetation and climate. You will also have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with modern field techniques.

## About

After completing the course, you will have an in-depth and applied knowledge of the most important processes in the Earth system in relation to a changing climate.

### Issues covered include:

- structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems
- biochemical cycles
- climate and human impacts on the Earth system


You will work in a group and under supervision design and carry out a  small research project linked to the geosystems aspect of the course. The projects cover the full scientific research cycle, including planning, fieldwork, data analysis, report writing and oral presentation of the results.

### **Teaching**

- lectures
- teaching in the field
- fieldwork
- group project

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field.
