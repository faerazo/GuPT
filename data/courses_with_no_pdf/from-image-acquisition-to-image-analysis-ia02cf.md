## Summary

This is a compact, hands-on from image acquisition to image analysis course. The example material used is mainly fluorescent bio-images, but the underlying concepts taught apply also to images from electron microscopy.

## About

The focus of the course is on reaching a broad understanding of imaging acquisition and computerized image analysis in Life Science and a basic understanding of the theory and algorithms behind the image analysis methods and tools. Hands-on exercises that will teach a broad functionality of these tools and the concepts needed for building suitable workflow for a given application.

This course provides:

- basic concepts in modern fluorescence microscopy: What is fluorescence, different fluorochromes, excitation methods, emission characteristics, purpose and uses
- basic concepts of digital images;
- basic computerized image analysis methods and computer exercises;

image processing in preparation for analysis;
- noise and image enhancement; and
- automatically analyzing large datasets.

The course will also:

- address the issues of image ethics and proper image acquisition for image analysis; and
- offer an introduction to a number of freely available software tools (Image/Fiji).

The course will be conducted in the lecture-hall, the Centre for Cellular Imaging facility, and in the computer classroom, one user for each computer. It will consist of both theoretical and practical classes with demos and hands-on at the microscope and analysis of image examples.

The course will be given in English.
