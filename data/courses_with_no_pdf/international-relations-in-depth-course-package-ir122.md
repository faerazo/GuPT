## Summary

Are you interested in better understanding phenomena such as war, international armed conflicts and security issues in the global order? Do you want to explore the causes of global prosperity and economic inequality? This course package provides you with in-depth knowledge of war, peace and security in international relations as well as an introduction to the field of global political economy.

## About

The course package consists of two courses in the field of international relations.

### War, peace and security

This course addresses the basic concepts of war, peace and security. It discusses how the concepts can be understood based on different theories, historical viewpoints and from diverse local and regional perspectives.

During the course, you will learn about the fundamental causes of war and how war has changed from the two world wars to the present day. You will also immerse yourself in the role that technological development plays in the changing character of war and what opportunities exist in the international system to build peace.

The course emphasizes the importance of gender as an important analytical category and highlights the importance of climate change for conflict patterns and security.

### Global Political Economy

This course provides you with an introduction to the global political economy from different theoretical standpoints and a historical perspective that gives the background for  understanding the contemporary world order.

During the course, you will also learn about key thematic areas of the global political economy, such as trade, finance, production and development. Additionally, you will focus on key contemporary issues, such as the future of neoliberalism, regional economic governance and perspectives on green economic development.

The course will give you a foundation in the field of global political economy and help you to use that knowledge to understand the global political economy today.

## Prerequisites and selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
