## About

The course focuses on up-to-date research aiming at deepen the knowledge about different aspects of benthic and planktonic primary producers together with their interactions with other organisms. The course is updated on a yearly basis. We concentrate on the following topics; toxic cyanobacterial blooms, how algal blooms are initiated, population genetics of diatoms, the role of benthic microalgae in the "coastal filter" and effects of increased ultraviolet radiation on Arctic/Antarctic primary producers. The course includes lectures, seminars and independent work.
