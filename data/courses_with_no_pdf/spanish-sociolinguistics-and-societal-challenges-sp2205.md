## Summary

Sociolinguistics ultimately aims to describe and explain sociolinguistic changes, that is, how language and society influence each other and contribute to maintaining and changing linguistic and social structures and practices. This course is based on a number of current societal challenges in the Spanish-speaking world such as inequality, climate change, racism, sexism, nationalism, and commercialism, and deals with how these challenges can be studied from the sociolinguistics perspective.

## About

The course is designed so that you can choose to specialise in a specific space/context (e.g. the classroom, the public sphere, social media, music or film), which then forms the starting point for the linguistic analyses and interpretation framework applied to the material.

The course is taught in Spanish.

## Prerequisites and selection
