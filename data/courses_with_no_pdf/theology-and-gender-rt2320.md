## Summary

.

## About

The issue of gender and sexuality is central not only to public debate, but also to theology and religious studies. Over the past years a rich theological discussion has developed about gender, including biblical studies, historical theology, spirituality and constructive systematic theology.

This course aims at developing an understanding of the gender theological field, with forays into general gender theory as well. It treats sexuality, body, and mysticism from feminist, queer, and masculinist perspectives, using both historical and contemporary materials. As such, the course offers a deeper understanding of how these perspectives influence – and are influenced by – classical theological teachings on the divine, Christology, salvation, and the church.
