## Summary

This course package is aimed at you who want an introduction to artistic studies in metal art. Throughout an entire semester, you will have the opportunity to explore different techniques in metal through assignments and themes with a focus on materials, body, and space.

## About

You will receive support in developing working methods and reflecting on your work, and also in communicating your choice of methods orally and in writing. Through lectures, supervised exercises, workshops, and tutorials, you will explore visual design and communication, as well as theory and history, providing a foundation for a rich and well-rounded education as you develop your craftsmanship.
