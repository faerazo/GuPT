## About

The overall objective of the course is to give an introduction to basic portfolio theory, including CAPM and APT analysis, and it’s use for evaluating portfolio performance. It is also an introduction to the valuation of derivative instruments, including options, forward contracts, futures contracts and swaps, and their various uses for hedging and speculation purposes.

The course includes detailed exercise sets and computer labs, involving internet data collection and computer analysis that should give the students the practical abilities to apply portfolio investment theory in order to analyze investment opportunities and conduct portfolio management.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.
