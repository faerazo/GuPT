## About

Representation theory is about how groups and other algebraic structures can be realized in a concrete way as linear transformations. These methods are not only used in algebra, but also in analysis, geometry, number theory and mathematical physics. For example, representation theory is a basis of the standard model of particle physics. In the course, we will focus on representation theory for rings (module theory) and finite groups. We also introduce tensor algebra and exterior algebra, which are important in differential geometry and relativity theory.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of 90 hec in mathematics including the course MMG500 Algebraic Structures.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
