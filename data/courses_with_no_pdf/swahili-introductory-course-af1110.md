## Summary

The course (taught in English) provides knowledge of basic linguistic terminology, as well as of the phonetics, phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics of Swahili.

## About

Swahili is a widely used language used daily by between 50 and 100 million people in East Africa and the rest of the world. The language is an outstanding example of Africa's linguistic diversity. It belongs to the Bantu language family, but has a variety of words from Arabic and other languages borrowed during hundreds of years of contact. Swahili is spoken in some of the world's fastest growing economies and thus increases in importance in the world. The course is aimed at those who want to learn a language that is constantly gaining in importance and who are curious about the language situation in East Africa.

This course is taught in English.
