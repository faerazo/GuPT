## Summary

This is a freestanding course that includes a full-time semester study in design with specialization in Wood Oriented Furniture Design. The course is aimed at those who want an introduction to artistic studies at academic level in the field of design and wood. You follow the first semester of the BFA Program in Wood Oriented Furniture Design.

## About

During the semester you will have the opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of wood materials and techniques. You explore different techniques, both proficiently and expressively, based on different tasks and themes, with starting point in the concept of material, body and space.

You get support in developing working methods and reflection on your own work, as well as communicating your choice of methods, both in writing and orally. Visual studies and literacy, as well as theory and history, are also included in the course. Teaching takes the form of lectures and exercises with supervision, workshops and briefings.

**The following courses are included in course package:**

- SBMD06 Wood Oriented Furniture Design 1, 18 credits
- SBHI01 Theory and History 1, 4.5 credits
- SBVI01 Visual Studies, Visual Literacy 1, 7.5 credits

**Course meetings** The course package is given with study pace 100% during the autumn semester. Students in the free-standing course co-study together with the program students in the BFA programme in Wood Orientated Furniture Design. The teaching takes place on site at HDK-Valand Campus Steneby. The language of instruction is English.

A more detailed schedule for the course will be published in the Learning Platform Canvas before the start of the course.

**Apply in three steps**

1. Apply for the course at universityadmissions.se. Deadline April 15, 2024.
2. Submit your portfolio [SlideRoom](https://applyartsgu.slideroom.eu/#/Login). Deadline April 15, 2024.
3. Submit documentation proving you meet the entry requirements of the course on universityadmissions.se. Deadline June 20, 2024.

**Your portfolio must contain;**

- CV, Previous experience and education. In this part, you refer to courses you have attended and describe past experiences that you believe are important for your application. Having attended a preparatory artistic training or preparatory wooden craft training is an advantage but not a requirement. Previous employments, hobbies or travels can be just as important to list here, if you find that it strengthens your application.
- Portfolio / work samples, 6 images. In this part you show own work that represent your creative experience. We want to see photographs of furniture and objects, drawings, sketches, paintings and/or croquis. Each uploaded photograph must have a caption explaining why the photograph is included in the application. Here we look at form and color, presentation and ideas. The education is based on independent and practical exploration of the material wood and therefore we would like to see examples of experience of this in your portfolio.

_Your application must be anonymous. Please do not include your name or any personal information in your application._

**Portfolio assessment**

The portfolio is assessed according to material knowledge and craft skills as well as artistic development potential.
