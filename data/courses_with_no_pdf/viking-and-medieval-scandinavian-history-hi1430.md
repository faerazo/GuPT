## Summary

This course covers the history of Scandinavia from the Viking Age (c.700 CE) until the Reformation. It broadly focuses on the region’s political, social, and cultural developments alongside its concurrent integration into Europe. We study Viking plundering raids and territorial expansion, state building, magic and pagan beliefs, and Christianization. Moreover, the course explores archeological and textual sources as well as images of Vikings and Scandinavian Middle Ages in popular culture.

## About

This course offers a broad survey of the political, social, and

cultural history of Viking Age and medieval Scandinavia. It explores the

Vikings—who they were, how they lived and made a living, what they

believed in, how they sought to organize their society, what regions

they explored, whom they loved, fought with, and befriended. We study

macro developments such as religious change, Christianization, and the

expansion of state or royal power as well as everyday life, including

beliefs and rituals, relations between women and men, violence, and

emotions. Developments in Viking society is examined and analyzed

against the backdrop of Scandinavia successively becoming integrated

into Europe. In the course of the semester, students gain a hands-on

experience with material objects such as archeological finds and runic

stones as well as Old Norse sagas, miracle stories, and chivalric

literature that make it possible to reconstruct this critical and

fascinating period in Scandinavian history. Moreover, we explore

contemporary images and the legacy of Vikings in popular culture.
