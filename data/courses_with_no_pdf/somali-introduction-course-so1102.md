## Summary

This introductory course is aimed at complete beginners in Somali. It focuses on the grammar and central vocabulary of standard Somali, but you will also learn a few things about the formation of standard Somali, where Somali is spoken and how it differs slightly between regions.

## About

This introductory course is aimed at complete beginners in Somali. It focuses on the grammar and central vocabulary of standard Somali. The course is based on reading of simple Somali texts and translation of these texts into English or a Scandinavian language. You will learn some 500 words and practice basic structures through exercises as well as translation into Somali. Further, the course gives you a short introduction to Somali’s formation process, its geographic distribution and regional variation. The course is completely net-based and it requires about 10 hours of active work each week: individual reading and active participation in obligatory discussions, assignments and web-based exercises.

The course has scheduled online classes.
