## Summary

This stand-alone course is for those who want to help shape a movement where we explore and write the history of craft practices that have operated outside the major cities.

## About

In the course Local Craft Cultures: History and Practice, students will work to analyse what it means to understand craft and craft history from different local perspectives. During the course, you will carry out your own project based on the place or land you are in. It is online to allow you to start from your place. During the course you will gain insight into methods for mapping, exploring and documenting craft practices, as well as how we can creatively represent this history.

We learn from each other, share knowledge and experiences. Together, we will make visible the diversity of crafts and write a variety of stories about how crafts have made many different lives possible, as well as fantasies about how things can be made.

The course is based on a broad definition of crafts ranging from textiles and ceramics to food, house building and various repair cultures such as car modification. It is aimed at those who are craftspeople, artists, curators, artisans, local historians or work in museums. It is designed both for those with an artistic background as well as those who are active in the cultural heritage sector or work with local community development.

We end the course by gathering all the projects for a joint presentation.
