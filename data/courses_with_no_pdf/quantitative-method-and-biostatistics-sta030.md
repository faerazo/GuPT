## Summary

This course gives the ability to interpret, understand and value medical statistical results. The students get the grip of both basic statistical methods, but also how to design studies, critical analyse and value articles and the ability to do analysis by themselves using own data.

## About

**Target group** The course is suitable for a student at master's level or equivalent who aims to refresh their statistical background before their degree project or other studies/projects. The course is also suitable for someone working as a project leader or equivalent in healthcare science.

### Content

The course discusses both basal statistics (such as scales, measures of central tendency, definitions of p-value, level of significance, power etc.) and more advanced methods as different tests (both parametric and non-parametric) and different regression methods. In addition, how to choose between different designs and hypothesis and the implications of these decisions are also introduced.

### After passing of the course

After passing of the course, you are supposed to be able to interpret, understand and value different statistical results. You understand the difference in interpretation, when used different methods and how to choose between these. You are also able to conduct an analysis by yourself by using a statistical program.
