## About

How does a systematic theologian work? What theoretical perspectives are used in contemporary systematic theology? What does it mean to be critical and constructive?

In this course, we seek a deeper understanding of the art and method of systematic theology, which makes it ideal as a preparation for theological thesis-writing at the advanced level. The focal point of the course is the relation between three important dimensions of work in systematic theology: text, reflection, and formation.
