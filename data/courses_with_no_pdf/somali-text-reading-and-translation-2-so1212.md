## Summary

This course, which builds on SO1211, gives you the opportunity to develop your reading skills as well as your translation skills from Somali into a Scandinavian language or English.

## About

This course builds on SO1211. It further develops reading skills in Somali, as well as practical translation skills from Somali into a Scandinavian language or English, through the study of 300 pages of original text, partly provided with comments, glossaries and sound recordings. The vocabulary is thereby increased to at least 4000 words and phrases. Throughout the course special attention is also paid to common types of translation problems and strategies, mainly through analysis and discussion of existing translations.

**The course has scheduled online classes.**

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

SO1211 or the equivalent. An exception is made from the requirement of Swedish as a general entry requirement, when the language of instruction is English.
