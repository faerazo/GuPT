## About

The course is a continuation of OCM100, Physical Oceanography I. It provides an introduction to time-dependent phenomena in the sea, such as waves and instabilities at both small and large scales. A great emphasis is on the physical understanding of how small amplitude disturbances propagate and how a rotating fluid naturally evolves toward a state of geostrophic balance, a process known as the geostrophic adjustment. The course will also give a review of how turbulent mixing takes place in the sea, describing what controls the seasonal variability of the surface mixed layer properties and what sets the stratification in the ocean's interior.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree in Natural Science, Engineering or Technology including 15 credits within Physical Oceanography.

Alternatively: 120 credits in the field of Natural Science where at least 60 credits must be completed courses in the fields of Mathematics, Physics and Meteorology and at least 15 credits within Physical Oceanography.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
