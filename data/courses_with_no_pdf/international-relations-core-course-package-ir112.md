## Summary

Are you interested in the contemporary global challenges we face? Do you seek deeper knowledge on issues such as war, global inequality, and environmental change? With the core course package in International Relations, you learn about key problems and issues in the international system and gain skills to analyse, investigate and evaluate global challenges.

## About

In International Relations you will study how the international system works politically, economically, and culturally and look at its historical evolution. You will learn about changing relations of power in the international system, and the ways in which connections between state and non-state actors contribute to the global order.

The package consists of the courses:

- [IR1121 Introduction to International Relations](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/IR1121)
- [IR1122 Themes and Issues in International Relations](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/IR1122)

**Introduction to International Relations** will provide you with a basic grounding in the study of international relations. It starts with a historical survey of key themes in international relations, such as war, economy, institutions, law and technology. You will then examine different analytic perspectives on international relations, in order to examine current real-world issues.

**Themes and Issues in International Relations** takes you further into key contemporary issues and problems, such as the role of religion in international politics, human rights, political violence, and poverty and inequalities. You will learn through interactive sessions and innovative coursework, focusing on student reflection, group activities, and visual representations of international relations.

International and global contexts, processes and institutions are playing a more important role in working life as a whole and for our everyday lives. In a globalized world, international relations are complex and shifting, and the demand for professionals with knowledge of global issues and competence to analyse international events have increased. Studying International Relations will give you skills to analyse, investigate and evaluate issues related to our changing world.

The courses use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, seminars, discussion sessions, groupwork and peer evaluation.
