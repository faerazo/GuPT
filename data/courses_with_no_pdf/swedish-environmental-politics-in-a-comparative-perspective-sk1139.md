## About

This course provides you with the analytical tools to understand the dynamics of Swedish environmental politics in a comparative perspective. It applies a historical perspective, gives insight to both “input” and “output” sides of the Swedish political system with relevance for environmental politics and, finally, provides insights in how domestic environmental policies relate to Sweden’s role in the EU and beyond in the international arena.

The individual assignment focuses on comparing how two environmental policies relate to different layers of the political system in Sweden.

The teaching consists of lectures and seminars. Students will be evaluated based on their performance on group work as well as individual assignments. The course will take advantage of interactions between Swedish and international students to form groups for a joint assignment in the form of a case study.
