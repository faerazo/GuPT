## Summary

This course addresses European integration, heritage and identity and the role of institutions and economic processes for European identity building. You will learn to analyse current European processes with political as well as social perspectives, and gain a thorough understanding of Europe’s historical past.

## About

This course addresses current processes of integration and disintegration in Europe, and the notion of the European today and in a historical context. Heritage and identity are closely linked to issues of politics and economics. The course relates various notions of what it means to be “European” to other identities, and analyzes the creation of history and memory within European institutions.

We pursue a historical perspective, where the first formulations of European as an identity, and myths on the European are scrutinized.

We continue over the rise of nationalisms and into the present-day building of narratives and an institutionalized European political landscape. Our object of study is the complex interplay between memories, heritage, history and identity and their multiple representations in symbols, monuments and different perceptions of their meaning.

We will address both historical cases of memory politics and the active building of symbols and narratives of the European union, as well as the rise of Euroscepticism as a counter narrative. Seemingly “soft” issues of heritage and identity are closely linked to “hard” issues of politics and economics. Our understanding of Europe today depends on knowledge of its past.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The entry requirements for the course is a Bachelor's degree of 180 credits, with a minimum of 90 credits in consecutive courses in a social sciences discipline, humanities discipline or equivalent. Students at the Law programme are also eligible the course after three years of studies (180 credits, equivalent of a bachelor degree). Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Once you have passed the course, you will be able to understand how the idea of Europe and European identity has developed, and what role institutions and economic processes play in European identity building. By evaluating and critically engaging with arguments in theory, literature and seminars, you will learn to analyse ideas about European identity and heritage, situate them in a historical context and develop an independent position on relevant concepts.
