## About

The course provides an overview of pragmatic theories, theories of meaning and communication that go beyond semantics, and their relation to related scientific fields. The course covers the history of pragmatics, basic concepts and theories, their applications, and pragmatic analysis practice. Selected areas of Pragmatics and theories are presented in more detail than in the corresponding course at the undergraduate level. Furthermore, the course aims to provide skills in pragmatic analysis of language use based on authentic language examples (written and spoken).

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

For those who study the course on campus, teaching takes place in the Faculty of Humanities' premises in central Gothenburg. Renströmsgatan 6.
