## Summary

This course is a direct continuation of AF1210, Swahili II, and focuses on developing the student's reading ability, communication and translation skills and linguistic knowledge of the Swahili language

Language of tuition: English

## About

In this course, your reading ability in Swahili is developed through the study of simple authentic texts provided with comments, glossaries and sound recordings. Your active vocabulary is expanded by about 500 words and phrases. Furthermore, word formation is studied to facilitate passive understanding of unknown words. Communication is practiced through practical application of frequent constructions. Translation skills are developed further, mainly from Swahili, but also into Swahili. The linguistic knowledge of the Swahili language is increased in both phonology, grammar and sociolinguistics, partly through the study of some simple scholarly articles. The theoretical focus of the course is on Swahili morphosyntax.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

5 credits from AF1210, Swahili II, or the equivalent. Proficiency in Swedish is not required.

### Selection
