## Summary

The course provides an introduction to scientific research methods with a focus on linguistics.

## About

It includes research ethics in relation to linguistic research, and writing skills for research papers. Depending on available time, the course might cover various research methods used in linguistics, such as experimentation, elicitation, corpus search, transcription, annotation, and formal/computational models.

The course comprises 30 credits and consists of 4 sub-courses of 7.5 credits. The module Linguistic Methods is compulsory, and two of the following three modules must be included:

• Syntax 2,

• Semantics 2,  and

• Pragmatics 2

One module can be chosen from the department's elective offerings. Examples of elective modules are:

• Methods for Studying Dialogue,

• Language Technology, and

• Phonetics.

LI2030 Semantics 2

The course provides an overview of theories of linguistic meaning – semantic theories and their relation to related scientific fields. The course covers the history of semantics, basic semantic concepts, applications of semantics, and semantic analysis. A selection of semantic concepts and theories are presented in more detail and partially formalised.

LI2040 Pragmatics 2

The course provides an overview of pragmatic theories, theories of meaning and communication that go beyond semantics, and their relation to related scientific fields. The course covers the history of pragmatics, basic concepts and theories, their applications, and pragmatic analysis practice. Selected areas of Pragmatics and theories are presented in more detail than in the corresponding course at the undergraduate level. Furthermore, the course aims to provide skills in pragmatic analysis of language use based on authentic language examples (written and spoken).

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

For those who study the course on campus, teaching takes place in the Faculty of Humanities' premises in central Gothenburg. Renströmsgatan 6.
