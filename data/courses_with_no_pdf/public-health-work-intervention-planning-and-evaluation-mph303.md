## About

The course focuses on practical application of public health theories and methods. The course contains a theoretical part in which the practical implications of previous courses are discussed, in particular how scientific methods can be used in evaluating targeted public health interventions. Models and methods for project planning are introduced, the basics of intervention research are treated as well as the importance of planning for future health evaluations. In addition, an internship is conducted within a national or international authority or organization under supervision and a report on the experience is produced by the student. Together with the internship supervisor, the student plans to ensure that the assignments agreed upon are met during the internship, together with the theoretical portion, these experiences lead to the achievement of the learning objectives stated in the syllabus. In order to support the process of achieving the learning outcomes, students will receive feedback on their work throughout the course from both teachers and peers.
