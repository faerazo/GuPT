## Summary

This distance course is addressed to students that have craft experience and seeking artistic understanding and development towards an arts and crafts practice.

## About

The first part of the course consists of stocktaking of current craft practice in order for you to formulate your expectations for your future artistic development. This is followed by a introduction to the importance of constructive feedback for others and yourself. Through a writing assignment, the students formulate their first feedback to another student’s craft practice.

In the second part of the course the students will be introduced to artistic development tools and methods. Every method will be applied with an assignment and the result will be discussed orally and in written form.

A theory workshop will create the student’s awareness of the importance of historic and contemporary references within arts and crafts. The assignments end with an investigation of historic references that have relevance to their own field of interest.

The entire course will end with implementing the new knowledge and understanding in a work project. The work result will be presented and discussed.

During the entire course an open forum offers space for networking and exchanging experience. All parts of the course are supported with individual tutoring.
