## About

The course treats yoga traditions in premodern time and their

transformation during late 19th century and 20th century to

specialisations of modern yoga. On the basis of contemporary research

within the field of history of religion, the course focuses on the

development of various yoga traditions from a historical point of view.

This entails studying the new ideas and practices that occurred during

the first millennium B.C.E, and that were first expressed in the

Upanishads and the new religions Buddhism and Jainism and later in the

form of classical Hindu yoga and hatha yoga, to the varieties of

different forms of yoga that are found today. Special focus will be

given to the development of modern forms of yoga, and on clarifying the

underlying processes connected to globalization and modernity that have

made this development possible.
