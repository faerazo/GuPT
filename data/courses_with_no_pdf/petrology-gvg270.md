## Summary

Petrology is a basic course in geology. Rocks contain a great deal of information, and the task of a petrologist is to unravel and interpret that information which can be used to investigate the historical and geological evolution of the Earth.

The course provides basic knowledge of petrology, which is the study of the origin of rocks. Lectures are combined with fieldwork.
