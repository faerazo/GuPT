## About

The aim of the course is to provide basic knowledge in marine micropaleontology, form the basis for further studies on the subject and provide support knowledge to students in other majors. The course includes studies of significant parts of the marine microfossil fauna and flora. An essential area of study concerns benthic and planktonic microorganisms and their importance for the interpretation of both present as well as ancient marine environments and climates. Micropaleontology is a key discipline for scientific interpretation, analyses and applications within environmental geology and petroleum geology.
