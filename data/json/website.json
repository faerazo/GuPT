What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more secure than another? This course answers these questions and more. We begin the course by looking at weaknesses that have plagued networked systems for years. We then continue with countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols such as SSL, SSH and IPsec and investigate in detail what makes them secure. The course also gives a survey of cryptographic tools and explains how they can be utilized in protocols and applications, for example how to provide secure user authentication over a public network.\n\nKnowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important not only for the network security specialist but also for application programmers and everyone else who wants to understand what level of security a system and an application can offer. By knowing the problems, future systems can be designed to be much more secure and reliable than today.\n\nThe course covers many topics related to communications and network security:\n\n- Network attacks, encryption and random number generation\n- Analysis of weaknesses and attacks against common protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Denial of service (DOS) attacks. Scanning and operating system fingerprinting.\n- Access control, authentication mechanisms, passwords, Radius, AAA, PKI, key distribution, Kerberos\n- Identity management, certificates, X.509, revocation, smart cards, LDAP, OCSP\n- Security protocols such as IPSec , SSL and SSH\n- Security in wireless networks, WEP, WPA, IEEE 802.1x, EAP, TKIP\n- Network design, firewalls, packet filters, proxies, NAT, tunnelling, ingress and egress filtering\n- Virtual private networks (VPN), tunnelling protocols, segmentation and remote access\n- Logs, alarms, syslog, SNMP\n- Link level security, VLAN technology, security in ARP, DHCP and DNS.\n\nThe course consists of a series of lectures and laborative exercises. The laborative exercises focus on network scanning, building firewalls and study of common security protocols such as SSL\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nSuccessfully completed two years of studies within the subject Computer Science or equivalent.

This course provides an introduction to this area. In particular it introduces the notion of dependent type, a type which can depend on (is indexed by) values of another type, for example, the type of vectors indexed by its length. Dependent types are versatile. Through the Curry-Howard identification of proposition and types virtually any property of a program can be expressed using dependent types. The aim of the course is to give a solid and broad foundation in type systems for programming languages, and also give examples of type-based technologies in computer science.\n\n- introduction to lambda calculus and simple type theory\n\n- introduction to operational semantics and type systems\n\n- dependent type theory\n\n- the Curry-Howard identification of propositions as types\n\n- programming in Agda, a proof assistant\n\n- presentation of advanced topics in type systems\n\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible to the course, the student should have successfully completed 120 credits of studies in computer science or mathematics, or equivalent. Specifically, a successfully completed 7.5 credit course in discrete mathematics (e.g., DIT980 Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists, or equivalent) and a successfully completed 7,5 credit course in functional programming (e.g. DIT143 Functional Programming, or equivalent is required.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

The aim of this course is to learn to design and analyze algorithms for network protocols and to gain knowledge in existing communication networks, including supporting systems and protocols, fundamental tasks and methods in data communication networks. Mastery of computer networks involves both theory and practice in the design, implementation and use of network protocols and services.\n\nThis course offers learning experiences that involve hands-on experimentation and analysis as they reinforce student understanding of concepts and their application to real-world problems. Several laboratory experiments are given and involve API programming for fault-tolerance network systems, and Internet interconnections and services from a practical perspective, and design and analysis of protocols with a strong emphasis on self-stabilizing algorithms.\n\nThis course provides the students with the analytical background needed for understanding fundamental issues in the design of distributed fault tolerance algorithms for computer network protocols. The course has a very strong emphasis on transient faults and how self-stabilizing algorithms can allow automatic recovery after their occurrence.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nThe requirement for the course is to have a Bachelor's degree within the subject Computer Science or equivalent.

We look at problems related to the analysis of biological sequence data (sequence bioinformatics) and macromolecular structures (structural bioinformatics).\n\nComputing scientists need to be able to understand problems that originate in areas that may be unfamiliar to them, and to identify computational methods and approaches that can be used to solve them. Biological concepts needed to understand the problems will be introduced.\n\nReading research articles is valuable training for scientists and researchers. Developing skill in reading research articles is useful preparation for future scientific studies, and at the same time their own scientific writing can be improved. Therefore, in this course, research articles are used as the main reference material, in particular to show how to present ideas and methods, and how to critically evaluate them.\n\nComputational methods and concepts featured in this course include: dynamic programming; heuristic algorithms; graph partitioning; image skeletonisation, smoothing and edge detection; clustering; sub-matrix matching; geometric hashing; constraint logic programming; Monte Carlo optimisation; simulated annealing; selfavoiding walks.\n\nBiological problems featured in this course include: sequence alignment; domain assignment; structure comparison; comparative modelling; protein folding; fold recognition; finding channels; molecular docking; protein design.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the course, the student should have successfully completed 60 credits of studies in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics, or equivalent. Furthermore, the student should have successfully completed a course in Programming (DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-orientation, DIT042 Object-oriented Programming, DIT143 Functional programming, or equivalent) and a basic course in discrete mathematic (DIT980, DIT856 or equivalent).\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Topics in the course are focused on new methods in the intersection of computer science and other domains, to support distributed operations, cyber security, and processing of data that are generated due to digitalization of these systems (considering that the data can be massive).\n\nThe content is focused on distributed computing and systems, data processing, information and systems security, networking and computer communication in the context of new cyber-physical systems. There are lectures from the faculty to give an overview of the areas of the course, and invited presentations from industry to talk about actual systems, as well as in-depth presentations by the student themselves on specific research topics relating to their projects.\n\nTypically, the lectures include an introduction to the new types of cyber-physical systems, e.g., the smart grid. Open research problems in relation to distributed operations, data-processing and cyber security are discussed, e.g., through lectures on streaming, security and privacy, and communication suitable in this domain. Examples of cyber-physical systems important for society are presented, e.g., the smart grid from both on the transmission and distribution perspective. The course starts with an introduction to power systems, to give students enough knowledge of terminology to understand papers connected to the smart grid.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor's degree in Computer Science, or equivalent is required.

During the years they have evolved in to many different forms and serve many different target groups, not least since the introduction of computer games. This course provides an overview of games in all their forms as well as theoretical concepts and frameworks to analyze games. The course is divided into four successive parts that consider different forms of games and different perspectives of gaming.\n\nThe first part looks at games as systems and focus on board games and card games as well as introduces general concepts to describe games and gaming. The second part transitions over to how players perceive and immerse themselves into games, using role-playing and larps to highlight the play experience as a perceptual stance. The third part highlights how different media forms impacts on games and gaming by focusing on computer games and online games. The final part examines how the boundaries between games and other activities can be obscured by the game design and how games can be used for other purposes than to entertain, for example to criticize, influence, or teach.\n\nEach part introduces theoretical concepts and frameworks through academic texts and builds on the previous part.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor degree of 180 higher educational credits or 60 higher educational credits in the main field of study of Computer Science.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

An abundance of data is produced in every sector of society. Data is a product of every human activity, from counting steps or calories on an individual level, to measuring societal aspects such as level of education and employment. The fundamental impact of this development gives rise to the need to ask question like: How do we use this data? For what purpose, and who benefits from it? This course will teach you how to begin answering such questions.\n\nDrawing from Science and Technology Studies and Critical Data Studies, you will be introduced to the concepts to understand the constructed nature of data. You will engage in exploring data through their collection, analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. You will develop the skills needed to connect the construction of data as a highly technological practice to broad social questions of structural inequalities, evidence, and knowledge. You will examine how datafication produced by digital technologies creates and structures society, and maintains certain asymmetries and power relations.\n\nThis course addresses master's students from the social sciences and the humanities who wish to develop skills in relation to data processing and visualisation while maintaining and furthering a critical mode of inquiry into practices that affect our life as individuals and society. It also speaks to students with technical backgrounds who wish to develop a more critical understanding of the social and political consequences of data-driven societies today.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the course the student must have a Bachelor's degree (180 credits).\n\nApplicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS, or alternatively a bachelor's degree from an education held in English.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications.\n\nAn embedded system is a computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions. It is embedded in the sense that it is part of a complete device, often including electrical hardware and mechanical parts. For reasons of safety and usability, some embedded systems have strict constraints on non-functional behavior such as computational delay and periodicity. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications.

It also covers simulation-based analysis methods for quantitative assessment of the impact of a particular architectural technique on performance.\n\nThe content is divided into the following parts:\n\n1\\. The first part covers aspects affecting the development of computer technology including Moore's Law, performance measures (execution time vs. throughput), benchmarking, and fundamentals of computer performance such as Amdahl's Law and memory access locality.\n\n2\\. The second part covers various techniques for exploiting instruction level parallelism (ILP) by defining key concepts of what ILP is and what limits it. The techniques covered fall into two categories: dynamic and static techniques. The main dynamic techniques covered are Tomasulo's algorithm, branch prediction and speculation. The most important static techniques are loop unrolling, software pipelining, trace scheduling and predicated instructions.\n\n3\\. The third part covers principles of modern memory hierarchies such as inclusive and non-inclusive memory hierarchies, lockup free caching techniques, prefetching, classification of cache misses.\n\n4\\. The fourth part deals with multi-core microprocessors and techniques such as multi-threading and cache coherence.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nSuccessfully completed two year of studies within the subject Computer Science or equivalent. The course DIT122 Datorsystemteknik or equivalent is required. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

The course regards these issues in specific development contexts, i.e. specific constellations of customers and suppliers as well as constraints related to the domain and development lifecycle that characterise developing a piece of software.\n\nThis course is on advanced level and takes a holistic view on the state of the art of\n\nrequirements engineering as part of successful software engineering, technology, and management. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with recent, relevant research in the field, to critically reflect on the implications of new findings, and to develop their abilities and expertise as software professionals.\n\nThe course teaches challenges, principles, and concrete practices related to the following subfields of requirements engineering (RE):\n\n\\- Requirements analysis\n\n\\- Elicitation\n\n\\- Analysis\n\n\\- Documentation\n\n\\- Negotiation\n\n\\- Verification and validation\n\n\\- Requirements management\n\n\\- Change management\n\n\\- Traceability\n\nBeyond a brief introduction into concrete notations of requirements, the course focuses on holistically managing requirements-related knowledge on relevant scopes, including:\n\n\\- Team level: knowledge within a software development team and accross several teams working in the same area.\n\n\\- Program level: knowledge within a particular product team or across a set of related product teams (e.g. agile release trains)\n\n\\- Enterprise level: knowledge related to managing a portfolio of products.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for this course the student should have:\n\n\\- a bachelor degree in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, or equivalent;\n\n\\- a successfully completed course in programming (e.g., DIT044 Object-oriented Programming, DIT013 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-orientation, DIT143 Functional Programming, or equivalent);\n\n\\- a successfully completed project course (or bachelor thesis) in applied software development or software engineering (e.g., DIT212 Object-oriented programming project, or DIT543 Software Engineering Project).\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Functional programming is one of the most promising approaches to the problem of how to program in parallel, as the computers around us inevitably become more and more parallel.\n\nThe course covers approaches to parallel functional programming in both Haskell and Erlang. It covers current research on these topics, and relies heavily on scientific papers as its source materials. However, we stress that the emphasis in the course is practical, rather than theoretical. Several of the lectures are given by leading external experts from both academia and industry.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nSuccessfully completed two years within the subject Computer Science or equivalent. The course participants must have completed an introductory course in Funtional Programming, preferably using Haskell or Erlang (examples at GU are DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming and DIT142 Functional Programming). Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

The course focuses mainly upon 2-dimensional games although other types of game engines are discussed, and students wishing to explore 3D game engines can do so as part of the assignment. During the course we will develop an example game engine which includes several of the key aspects of professional game engine systems.\n\nThe course will cover timing regulation, game object architecture, collision action, collision responses, and some simple physics. It will also discuss relevant design decisions and design patterns. It is not expected during this course that you will develop a feasible competitor for what is on the market. Rather, the process of building a game engine is intended to be illuminating when developing games in more robust engines.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for this course, students must have either:\n\n\\- successfully completed the course Computer Graphics, 7.5 credits, or equivalent, or\n\n\\- have 15 credits of programming experience, of which 7.5 of those credits should be in an object-oriented context.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

To avoid unnecessary complexity one often chooses to study computation via simplified, but powerful, models. These models can for instance be simple programming languages (like the -calculus), or idealised computers (like Turing machines). In thecourse several such models will be studied, both \"imperative\" and \"functional\". One or more models will be used to explore the limits of computation: problems that cannot be solved (within the confines of a given model), and programs that can run arbitrary programs (modelled in a certain way).The course also includes a discussion of the Church-Turing thesis, a hypothesis which states, roughly, that a function is computable in a certain intuitive sense only if it can be defined within one of several models of computation.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible to the course, the student should have successfully completed 120 credits of studies in Computer Science or equivalent.\n\nSpecifically, the following courses are required, or equivalent:\n\n7\\\\.5 credits in discrete mathematics (e.g., DIT980 Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists)\n\n7\\\\.5 credits in functional programming (e.g., DIT143 Functional Programming or DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming)\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

The use of digital technology in sports affects how sports teams are organized and managed, how we gain access to sports information and design new sports equipment. Digitization has also created new sports, such as e-Sports, which have major consequences for the perception of what sports are and how sports are practiced. The development of analytical technology to support performance improvement has also been intensified with the help of digitalisation.**\n\nThis course gives you the opportunity to acquire and apply knowledge about digitalisation in sports as a general societal phenomenon as well as professionalized specialized activities. After the course, you will have the ability to analyze, evaluate and explain how digitalisation affects and develops different sports.\n\n### Online education\n\nThe course is given entirely online. You will have the possibility to participate in the course in a way that suits you. You can either follow the course synchronously, with lectures and seminars online, or take part in the content asynchronously, when you have time. It is also possible to adapt the course pace to your own circumstances. In this way, it is possible to complete the course alongside other activities, such as work or other studies.\n\n### Multiple perspectives\n\nYou will gain insights into how digital technologies have influenced endurance sports such as running, cycling and cross-country skiing, as well as team sports such as football and ice hockey. We will also focus on emerging technologies and platforms.\n\nThe perspectives that will be treated, the literature as well as guest lecturers in the course are chosen based on an effort to offer a breadth of approaches that are inclusive and equal.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor's degree (180 credits). Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

In this context, we consider as learning to draw conclusions from given data or experience which results in some model that generalises these data. Inference is to compute the desired answers or actions based on the model.\n\nAlgorithms of this kind are commonly used in for example classification tasks (e.g., character recognition, or to predict if a new customer is creditworthy) and in expert systems (e.g., for medical diagnosis). A new and commercially important area of application is data mining, where the algorithms are used to automatically detect interesting information and relations in large commercial or scientific databases.\n\nThe course intends to give a good understanding of this crossdisciplinary area, with a sufficient depth to use and evaluate the available methods, and to understand the scientific literature. During the course we may discuss potential problems with machine learning methods, for example, bias in training data and safety of autonomous agents.\n\nThe following concepts are covered:\n\n- Bayesian learning: likelihood, prior, posterior.\n\n- Supervised learning: Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Standard and CNN), Support Vector Machines, regression models, K-nn models.\n- Unsupervised learning: Clustering algorithms, EM algorithm, Mixture models,\n\n- Kernel methods,\n\n- Temporal machine learning models (for example RNN)\n\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible to the course, the student should have a bachelor degree.\n\nIn particular, the student must have acquired the following knowledge:\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of programming (e.g., DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming, DIT042 Object-Oriented Programming, DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-Orientation, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of data structures (e.g., DIT961 Data Structures, DIT181 Data Structures and Algorithms, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of basic probability and statistics (e.g., MSG810 Mathematical Statistics and Discrete Mathematics, DIT861 Statistical Methods for Data Science, or equivalent) - 7.5 credits of linear algebra (e.g., MMGD20 Linear Algebra, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of multivariate calculus.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

The course builds on skills in firstorder logic and temporal logic, and shows how these formalisms can be applied, and extended, for the verification of software.\n\nOn the model checking side, we cover the following topics:\n\n\\- a specification language for concurrent processes,\n\n\\- verifying assertions,\n\n\\- synchronization,\n\n\\- verifying safety and liveness properties in temporal logic.\n\nOn the deductive verification side, we cover the following topics:\n\n\\- a unit level specification language for Java programs,\n\n\\- a logic for verification of Java programs,\n\n\\- verification of Java programs, in the sense that the implementation of a unit fulfils the specification.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nSuccessfully completed courses corresponding to 120 credits within the subject Computer Science or equivalent, specifically DIT201 Logic in Computer Science, 7.5 credits, and a 7.5 credits course in object-oriented programming (or equivalent) are required.

The goal of these environments can vary from experimental environments in the automotive or aerospace industry, learning environments in simulations for pure entertainment environments on home computers or game consoles. The course covers general design methods that can be applied in all these areas.\n\nThe course aims to provide an understanding of how all the components in a game environment interact with each other as well as the relations gameplay design have to other areas necessary for contemporary interactive simulations, such as programming and graphical design. Key issues addressed in the course is how to motivate users to some specific interaction, the relationship between interaction and narrative, how to balance the interaction in multi-user environments, how to support and encourage the creativity of the user, how to modify the design solutions to suit both new and experienced users as well as how to change design solutions to suit the interaction sessions with time constraints.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the course the student must have a Bachelor's degree, 180credits or have passed 60 credits in the subject Computer Science.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a discipline that is concerned with how we design, develop, and evaluate robotic agents with the user in the loop. This course introduces the HRI design practices, evaluation methods and approaches. In particular, the course will apply human-centered approaches to design for the (1) abilities to consider in a robot, the (2) interaction modalities a robot should have, and (3) the form and appearance of a robot. The course will also give an understanding of the impact robots can have on our society, and the importance of the ethical and critical considerations when designing them.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the course the student must have a Bachelor degree of 180 credits.
