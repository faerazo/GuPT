What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more secure than another? This course answers these questions and more. We begin the course by looking at weaknesses that have plagued networked systems for years. We then continue with countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols such as SSL, SSH and IPsec and investigate in detail what makes them secure. The course also gives a survey of cryptographic tools and explains how they can be utilized in protocols and applications, for example how to provide secure user authentication over a public network.\n\nKnowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important not only for the network security specialist but also for application programmers and everyone else who wants to understand what level of security a system and an application can offer. By knowing the problems, future systems can be designed to be much more secure and reliable than today.\n\nThe course covers many topics related to communications and network security:\n\n- Network attacks, encryption and random number generation\n- Analysis of weaknesses and attacks against common protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Denial of service (DOS) attacks. Scanning and operating system fingerprinting.\n- Access control, authentication mechanisms, passwords, Radius, AAA, PKI, key distribution, Kerberos\n- Identity management, certificates, X.509, revocation, smart cards, LDAP, OCSP\n- Security protocols such as IPSec , SSL and SSH\n- Security in wireless networks, WEP, WPA, IEEE 802.1x, EAP, TKIP\n- Network design, firewalls, packet filters, proxies, NAT, tunnelling, ingress and egress filtering\n- Virtual private networks (VPN), tunnelling protocols, segmentation and remote access\n- Logs, alarms, syslog, SNMP\n- Link level security, VLAN technology, security in ARP, DHCP and DNS.\n\nThe course consists of a series of lectures and laborative exercises. The laborative exercises focus on network scanning, building firewalls and study of common security protocols such as SSL\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nSuccessfully completed two years of studies within the subject Computer Science or equivalent.

    "course_content": "This course is intended to give basic knowledge about methods for the design and analysis of real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications.\n\nAn embedded system is a computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions. It is embedded in the sense that it is part of a complete device, often including electrical hardware and mechanical parts. For reasons of safety and usability, some embedded systems have strict constraints on non-functional behavior such as computational delay and periodicity. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications. This course is intended to give basic knowledge about methods for the design and analysis of real-time systems.\n\nDue to the extremely high costs associated with late discovery of problems in embedded systems, it is important to follow a good design methodology during the development of the software and hardware. One means for that is to use a system architecture that offers good component abstractions and facilitates simple interfacing of components. The system architecture philosophy dictates that the software of an embedded system is organized into multiple concurrently-executing tasks, where each task (or group of tasks) implements a specific functionality in the system. This approach allows for an intuitive way of decomposing a complex system into smaller software units that are simple to comprehend, implement and maintain.\n\nThe software environment used in the course is based on the C programming language, enhanced with a software library that provides support for programming of concurrent tasks with timing (delay and periodicity) constraints. To that end, a main objective of the course is to demonstrate how the enhanced C programming language is used for implementing communication/synchronization between tasks, resource management and mutual exclusion. Since other programming languages uses monitors or semaphores to implement these functions, the course also contains a presentation of such techniques. In addition, the course demonstrates how to use low-level programming in C to implement interrupt-driven interaction with hardware devices. To demonstrate the general principles in real-time programming, the course also gives examples of how these techniques are implemented in other programming languages, such as Ada and Java.\n\nIn order to execute a program containing concurrent tasks there is a run-time system (real-time kernel) that distributes the available capacity of the microprocessor(s) among the tasks. The course shows how a simple run-time system is organized. The run-time system determines the order of execution for the tasks by means of a scheduling algorithm. To that end, the course presents techniques based on cyclic time-table based scheduling as well as scheduling techniques using static or dynamic task priorities. In addition, protocols for the management of shared hardware and software resources are presented. Since many contemporary real-time applications are distributed over multiple computer nodes, the course also presents topologies and medium access mechanisms for some commonly-used communication networks.\n\nIn real-time systems, where tasks have strict timing constraints, it is necessary to make a pre-run-time analysis of the system schedulability. The course presents three different analysis methods for systems that schedule tasks using static or dynamic priorities: utilization-based analysis, response-time analysis, and processor-demand analysis. In conjunction with this, the course also gives an account on how to derive the maximum resource requirement (worst-case execution time) of a task.",
    "assessment": "The student is evaluated by means of a written exam and a compulsory laboratory assignment.\n\nIf a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).\n\nIn cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.",

    "assessment": "The course is examined by an oral presentation normally performed in pairs, and by an individual take home examination.

For the oral presentation, the student can select either a research paper or a chapter in the course book involving applications of type systems not covered in the lectures. If the take-home exam is handed in too late it is failed. An oral examination is used as reexamination. If a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance). In cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.",

Students formulate several research questions of their choosing around games, and during the course they develop the skills required to provide answers to those questions. The course introduces three key research perspectives that are useful for game studies. We make use of the systemic perspective, which explores how games work. We look at the experiential perspective, which explores how games make us feel. And we look at the critical perspective, which focuses on what games are trying to say. The course also has a strong focus on ‘learning by playing’, recognising that games are the primary text of their discipline. Students taking this course will have an opportunity to try out tabletop roleplaying for themselves, as well as a chance to play a curated selection of modern board games.

During the years they have evolved in to many different forms and serve many different target groups, not least since the introduction of computer games. This course provides an overview of games in all their forms as well as theoretical concepts and frameworks to analyze games. The course is divided into four successive parts that consider different forms of games and different perspectives of gaming.\n\nThe first part looks at games as systems and focus on board games and card games as well as introduces general concepts to describe games and gaming. The second part transitions over to how players perceive and immerse themselves into games, using role-playing and larps to highlight the play experience as a perceptual stance. The third part highlights how different media forms impacts on games and gaming by focusing on computer games and online games. The final part examines how the boundaries between games and other activities can be obscured by the game design and how games can be used for other purposes than to entertain, for example to criticize, influence, or teach.\n\nEach part introduces theoretical concepts and frameworks through academic texts and builds on the previous part.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor degree of 180 higher educational credits or 60 higher educational credits in the main field of study of Computer Science.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

In particular, we will address and study the following issues in distributed systems: Synchronization: Continuation (after the course DIT240 Distributed systems ) of the study of distributed clock-synchronization and its uses in mutual exclusion; study about resource allocation in general. Advance one step further, to see how to get solutions without the need for clock synchronisation (and hence of lower cost in practice). Replication: The advantages and costs of replicating data: the potential improvement in response times and reliability, and the extra communication costs involved in keeping data consistent. Concurrency control: Study of different types of locking, deadlock detection. Additionally, study of concurrency control methods without locking. Recovery and Fault Tolerance: Check-pointing, optimistic and pessimistic recovery control. Fault-tolerant Agreement in Distributed Systems: (a very special and significant problem, since it is a key issue in most synchronization and coordination problems in distributed systems) Study of the basic impossibility results and discuss their implications; proceed with solutions and protocols for systems with certain strengths and design structures.

In this context, we consider as learning to draw conclusions from given data or experience which results in some model that generalises these data. Inference is to compute the desired answers or actions based on the model.\n\nAlgorithms of this kind are commonly used in for example classification tasks (e.g., character recognition, or to predict if a new customer is creditworthy) and in expert systems (e.g., for medical diagnosis). A new and commercially important area of application is data mining, where the algorithms are used to automatically detect interesting information and relations in large commercial or scientific databases.\n\nThe course intends to give a good understanding of this crossdisciplinary area, with a sufficient depth to use and evaluate the available methods, and to understand the scientific literature. During the course we may discuss potential problems with machine learning methods, for example, bias in training data and safety of autonomous agents.\n\nThe following concepts are covered:\n\n- Bayesian learning: likelihood, prior, posterior.\n\n- Supervised learning: Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Standard and CNN), Support Vector Machines, regression models, K-nn models.\n- Unsupervised learning: Clustering algorithms, EM algorithm, Mixture models,\n\n- Kernel methods,\n\n- Temporal machine learning models (for example RNN)\n\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible to the course, the student should have a bachelor degree.\n\nIn particular, the student must have acquired the following knowledge:\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of programming (e.g., DIT440 Introduction to Functional Programming, DIT042 Object-Oriented Programming, DIT012 Imperative Programming with Basic Object-Orientation, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of data structures (e.g., DIT961 Data Structures, DIT181 Data Structures and Algorithms, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of basic probability and statistics (e.g., MSG810 Mathematical Statistics and Discrete Mathematics, DIT861 Statistical Methods for Data Science, or equivalent) - 7.5 credits of linear algebra (e.g., MMGD20 Linear Algebra, or equivalent)\n\n\\- 7\\\\.5 credits of multivariate calculus.\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

An important part of the discussion are mechanisms for synchronization and data exchange. Next, performance analysis of parallel programs is covered.\n\nThe course proceeds with a discussion of tools and techniques for developing parallel programs in shared address spaces. This section covers popular programming environments such as pthreads and OpenMP.\n\nNext the course discusses the development of parallel programs for distributed address space. The focus in this part is on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Finally, we discuss programming approaches for executing applications on accelerators such as GPUs. This part introduces the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming environment.\n\nThe lectures are complemented with a set of laboratory sessions in which participants explore the topics introduced in the lectures. During the lab sessions, participants parallelize sample programs over a variety of parallel architectures, and use performance analysis tools to detect and remove bottlenecks in the parallel implementations of the programs.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nTo be eligible for the course, students should have successfully completed courses corresponding to 105 credits within the subject of Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or equivalent.\n\nIncluding a 7.5 credits course in machine-oriented programming (e.g., DIT151 Machine Oriented Programming, or equivalent).\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Topics in the course are focused on new methods in the intersection of computer science and other domains, to support distributed operations, cyber security, and processing of data that are generated due to digitalization of these systems (considering that the data can be massive).\n\nThe content is focused on distributed computing and systems, data processing, information and systems security, networking and computer communication in the context of new cyber-physical systems. There are lectures from the faculty to give an overview of the areas of the course, and invited presentations from industry to talk about actual systems, as well as in-depth presentations by the student themselves on specific research topics relating to their projects.\n\nTypically, the lectures include an introduction to the new types of cyber-physical systems, e.g., the smart grid. Open research problems in relation to distributed operations, data-processing and cyber security are discussed, e.g., through lectures on streaming, security and privacy, and communication suitable in this domain. Examples of cyber-physical systems important for society are presented, e.g., the smart grid from both on the transmission and distribution perspective. The course starts with an introduction to power systems, to give students enough knowledge of terminology to understand papers connected to the smart grid.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor's degree in Computer Science, or equivalent is required. The student should have successfully completed the following courses (or equivalent):\n\nDIT791 Introduction to ComputerEngineering, 7.5 hec\n\nDIT602 Algorithms, 7.5 hec\n\nDIT960 Data Structures, 7.5 hec\n\nand at least 7.5 hec in programming.\n\nFurthermore, the student should have completed 7.5 hec or equivalent in one of the four areas:\n\nComputer Communication (such as DIT423 or equivalent), or\n\nOperating Systems (such as DIT401 or equivalent), or\n\nComputer Security (such as DIT641 or equivalent), or\n\nDistributed Systems (such as DIT240 or equivalent).\n\nApplicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply \\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.

Designing interactive systems is often, but not always about designing for efficiency in a user-centered manner. In this course, we explore theories and alternative approaches to interaction design as a complement to user-centered design. We acknowledge the need to design for efficiency, but aim instead for playfulness, criticism, embodiment or various emotions (e.g. fear, joy, comfort), all of which are supported by the conceptual framing of the design. In this course we will look closer at different fringe theories within interaction design, and discuss and practice how to design with them through the analysis and development of design concepts.",

Mastery of computer networks involves both theory and practice in the design, implementation and use of network protocols and services.\n\nThis course offers learning experiences that involve hands-on experimentation and analysis as they reinforce student understanding of concepts and their application to real-world problems. Several laboratory experiments are given and involve API programming for fault-tolerance network systems, and Internet interconnections and services from a practical perspective, and design and analysis of protocols with a strong emphasis on self-stabilizing algorithms.\n\nThis course provides the students with the analytical background needed for understanding fundamental issues in the design of distributed fault tolerance algorithms for computer network protocols.

An abundance of data is produced in every sector of society. Data is a product of every human activity, from counting steps or calories on an individual level, to measuring societal aspects such as level of education and employment. The fundamental impact of this development gives rise to the need to ask question like: How do we use this data? For what purpose, and who benefits from it? This course will teach you how to begin answering such questions.\n\nDrawing from Science and Technology Studies and Critical Data Studies, you will be introduced to the concepts to understand the constructed nature of data. You will engage in exploring data through their collection, analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. You will develop the skills needed to connect the construction of data as a highly technological practice to broad social questions of structural inequalities, evidence, and knowledge. You will examine how datafication produced by digital technologies creates and structures society, and maintains certain asymmetries and power relations.\n\nThis course addresses master's students from the social sciences and the humanities who wish to develop skills in relation to data processing and visualisation while maintaining and furthering a critical mode of inquiry into practices that affect our life as individuals and society.

The use of digital technology in sports affects how sports teams are organized and managed, how we gain access to sports information and design new sports equipment. Digitization has also created new sports, such as e-Sports, which have major consequences for the perception of what sports are and how sports are practiced. The development of analytical technology to support performance improvement has also been intensified with the help of digitalisation.**\n\nThis course gives you the opportunity to acquire and apply knowledge about digitalisation in sports as a general societal phenomenon as well as professionalized specialized activities. After the course, you will have the ability to analyze, evaluate and explain how digitalisation affects and develops different sports.\n\n### Online education\n\nThe course is given entirely online. You will have the possibility to participate in the course in a way that suits you. You can either follow the course synchronously, with lectures and seminars online, or take part in the content asynchronously, when you have time. It is also possible to adapt the course pace to your own circumstances. In this way, it is possible to complete the course alongside other activities, such as work or other studies.\n\n### Multiple perspectives\n\nYou will gain insights into how digital technologies have influenced endurance sports such as running, cycling and cross-country skiing, as well as team sports such as football and ice hockey. We will also focus on emerging technologies and platforms.\n\nThe perspectives that will be treated, the literature as well as guest lecturers in the course are chosen based on an effort to offer a breadth of approaches that are inclusive and equal.\n\n## Prerequisites and selection\n\n### Entry requirements\n\nBachelor's degree (180 credits). Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.\n\n### Selection\n\nSelection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.\n\n## Study at The University of Gothenburg\n\n[![](/sites/default/files/dynamic-image/dynamic_image_2188_218/public/2020-03/cytonn-photography-ZJEKICY5EXY-unsplash.jpg?media_id=2553&width=1904&height=208)\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to apply\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTo be admitted to the University, you need to do an online application.
