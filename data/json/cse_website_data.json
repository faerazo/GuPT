In this context, we consider as learning to draw conclusions from given data or experience which results in some model that generalises these data. Inference is to compute the desired answers or actions based on the model.\nAlgorithms of this kind are commonly used in for example classification tasks (e.g., character recognition, or to predict if a new customer is creditworthy) and in expert systems (e.g., for medical diagnosis). A new and commercially important area of application is data mining, where the algorithms are used to automatically detect interesting information and relations in large commercial or scientific databases.\nThe course intends to give a good understanding of this crossdisciplinary area, with a sufficient depth to use and evaluate the available methods, and to understand the scientific literature. During the course we may discuss potential problems with machine learning methods, for example, bias in training data and safety of autonomous agents.\nThe following concepts are covered:\nBayesian learning: likelihood, prior, posterior.\nSupervised learning: Bayes classifier, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Standard and CNN), Support Vector Machines, regression models, K-nn models.\nUnsupervised learning: Clustering algorithms, EM algorithm, Mixture models,\nKernel methods,\nTemporal machine learning models (for example RNN)",

The course is divided into four successive parts that consider different forms of games and different perspectives of gaming.\nThe first part looks at games as systems and focus on board games and card games as well as introduces general concepts to describe games and gaming. The second part transitions over to how players perceive and immerse themselves into games, using role-playing and larps to highlight the play experience as a perceptual stance. The third part highlights how different media forms impacts on games and gaming by focusing on computer games and online games. The final part examines how the boundaries between games and other activities can be obscured by the game design and how games can be used for other purposes than to entertain, for example to criticize, influence, or teach.\nEach part introduces theoretical concepts and frameworks through academic texts and builds on the previous part.",

In thecourse several such models will be studied, both \"imperative\" and \"functional\". One or more models will be used to explore the limits of computation: problems that cannot be solved (within the confines of a given model), and programs that can run arbitrary programs (modelled in a certain way).The course also includes a discussion of the Church-Turing thesis, a hypothesis which states, roughly, that a function is computable in a certain intuitive sense only if it can be defined within one of several models of computation.",

We look at problems related to the analysis of biological sequence data (sequence bioinformatics) and macromolecular structures (structural bioinformatics).\nComputing scientists need to be able to understand problems that originate in areas that may be unfamiliar to them, and to identify computational methods and approaches that can be used to solve them. Biological concepts needed to understand the problems will be introduced.\nReading research articles is valuable training for scientists and researchers. Developing skill in reading research articles is useful preparation for future scientific studies, and at the same time their own scientific writing can be improved. Therefore, in this course, research articles are used as the main reference material, in particular to show how to present ideas and methods, and how to critically evaluate them.\nComputational methods and concepts featured in this course include: dynamic programming; heuristic algorithms; graph partitioning; image skeletonisation, smoothing and edge detection; clustering; sub-matrix matching; geometric hashing; constraint logic programming; Monte Carlo optimisation; simulated annealing; selfavoiding walks.\nBiological problems featured in this course include: sequence alignment; domain assignment; structure comparison; comparative modelling; protein folding; fold recognition; finding channels; molecular docking; protein design.",

The first part covers aspects affecting the development of computer technology including Moore's Law, performance measures (execution time vs. throughput), benchmarking, and fundamentals of computer performance such as Amdahl's Law and memory access locality.\n2. The second part covers various techniques for exploiting instruction level parallelism (ILP) by defining key concepts of what ILP is and what limits it. The techniques covered fall into two categories: dynamic and static techniques. The main dynamic techniques covered are Tomasulo's algorithm, branch prediction and speculation. The most important static techniques are loop unrolling, software pipelining, trace scheduling and predicated instructions.\n3. The third part covers principles of modern memory hierarchies such as inclusive and non-inclusive memory hierarchies, lockup free caching techniques, prefetching, classification of cache misses.\n4. The fourth part deals with multi-core microprocessors and techniques such as multi-threading and cache coherence.",

The aim of this course is to learn to design and analyze algorithms for network protocols and to gain knowledge in existing communication networks, including supporting systems and protocols, fundamental tasks and methods in data communication networks. Mastery of computer networks involves both theory and practice in the design, implementation and use of network protocols and services.\nThis course offers learning experiences that involve hands-on experimentation and analysis as they reinforce student understanding of concepts and their application to real-world problems. Several laboratory experiments are given and involve API programming for fault-tolerance network systems, and Internet interconnections and services from a practical perspective, and design and analysis of protocols with a strong emphasis on self-stabilizing algorithms.\nThis course provides the students with the analytical background needed for understanding fundamental issues in the design of distributed fault tolerance algorithms for computer network protocols.

      "about": "Data is drastically changing how we function, both as individuals and as societies. An abundance of data is produced in every sector of society. Data is a product of every human activity, from counting steps or calories on an individual level, to measuring societal aspects such as level of education and employment. The fundamental impact of this development gives rise to the need to ask question like: How do we use this data? For what purpose, and who benefits from it? This course will teach you how to begin answering such questions.\nDrawing from Science and Technology Studies and Critical Data Studies, you will be introduced to the concepts to understand the constructed nature of data. You will engage in exploring data through their collection, analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. You will develop the skills needed to connect the construction of data as a highly technological practice to broad social questions of structural inequalities, evidence, and knowledge. You will examine how datafication produced by digital technologies creates and structures society, and maintains certain asymmetries and power relations.\nThis course addresses master's students from the social sciences and the humanities who wish to develop skills in relation to data processing and visualisation while maintaining and furthering a critical mode of inquiry into practices that affect our life as individuals and society. It also speaks to students with technical backgrounds who wish to develop a more critical understanding of the social and political consequences of data-driven societies today.",

There are lectures from the faculty to give an overview of the areas of the course, and invited presentations from industry to talk about actual systems, as well as in-depth presentations by the student themselves on specific research topics relating to their projects.\nTypically, the lectures include an introduction to the new types of cyber-physical systems, e.g., the smart grid. Open research problems in relation to distributed operations, data-processing and cyber security are discussed, e.g., through lectures on streaming, security and privacy, and communication suitable in this domain. Examples of cyber-physical systems important for society are presented, e.g., the smart grid from both on the transmission and distribution perspective. The course starts with an introduction to power systems, to give students enough knowledge of terminology to understand papers connected to the smart grid.",

During the course we will develop an example game engine which  includes several of the key aspects of professional game engine systems.\nThe course will cover timing regulation, game object architecture, collision action, collision responses, and some simple  physics. It will also discuss relevant design decisions and design patterns. It is not expected during this course that you will develop a feasible competitor for what is on the market. Rather, the process of  building a game engine is intended to be illuminating when developing games in more robust engines.",

The goal of these environments can vary from experimental environments in the automotive or aerospace industry, learning environments in simulations for pure entertainment environments on home computers or game consoles. The course covers general design methods that can be applied in all these areas.\nThe course aims to provide an understanding of how all the components in a game environment interact with each other as well as the relations gameplay design have to other areas necessary for contemporary interactive simulations, such as programming and graphical design. Key issues addressed in the course is how to motivate users to some specific interaction, the relationship between interaction and narrative, how to balance the interaction in multi-user environments, how to support and encourage the creativity of the user, how to modify the design solutions to suit both new and experienced users as well as how to change design solutions to suit the interaction sessions with time constraints.",

Next, performance analysis of parallel programs is covered.\nThe course proceeds with a discussion of tools and techniques for developing parallel programs in shared address spaces. This section covers popular programming environments such as pthreads and OpenMP.\nNext the course discusses the development of parallel programs for distributed address space. The focus in this part is on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Finally, we discuss programming approaches for executing applications on accelerators such as GPUs. This part introduces the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming environment.\nThe lectures are complemented with a set of laboratory sessions in which participants explore the topics introduced in the lectures. During the lab sessions, participants parallelize sample programs over a variety of parallel architectures, and use performance analysis tools to detect and remove bottlenecks in the parallel implementations of the programs.",

      "about": "Why is it possible to break into networked computer systems? What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more secure than another? This course answers these questions and more. We begin the course by looking at weaknesses that have plagued networked systems for years. We then continue with countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols such as SSL, SSH and IPsec and investigate in detail what makes them secure. The course also gives a survey of cryptographic tools and explains how they can be utilized in protocols and applications, for example how to provide secure user authentication over a public network.\nKnowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important not only for the network security specialist but also for application programmers and everyone else who wants to understand what level of security a system and an application can offer. By knowing the problems, future systems can be designed to be much more secure and reliable than today.\nThe course covers many topics related to communications and network security:\nNetwork attacks, encryption and random number generation\nAnalysis of weaknesses and attacks against common protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Denial of service (DOS) attacks. Scanning and operating system fingerprinting.\nAccess control, authentication mechanisms, passwords, Radius, AAA, PKI, key distribution, Kerberos\nIdentity management, certificates, X.509, revocation, smart cards, LDAP, OCSP\nSecurity protocols such as IPSec , SSL and SSH\nSecurity in wireless networks, WEP, WPA, IEEE 802.1x, EAP, TKIP\nNetwork design, firewalls, packet filters, proxies, NAT, tunnelling, ingress and egress filtering\nVirtual private networks (VPN), tunnelling protocols, segmentation and remote access\nLogs, alarms, syslog, SNMP\nLink level security, VLAN technology, security in ARP, DHCP and DNS.\nThe course consists of a series of lectures and laborative exercises. The laborative exercises focus on network scanning, building firewalls and study of common security protocols such as SSL",

Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications.\nAn embedded system is a computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions. It is embedded in the sense that it is part of a complete device, often including electrical hardware and mechanical parts. For reasons of safety and usability, some embedded systems have strict constraints on non-functional behavior such as computational delay and periodicity. Such systems are referred to as real-time systems. Examples of real-time systems are control systems for cars, aircraft and space vehicles as well as computer games and multimedia applications. This course is intended to give basic knowledge about methods for the design and analysis of real-time systems",
