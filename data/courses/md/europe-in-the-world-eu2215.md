## Summary

This course examines the political, economic, social and security relations of Europe with the rest of the world from historical and contemporary perspectives. You will study Europe in a broad sense that encompasses various international organizations, state actors and civil society. The course assesses both what impact European integration has had internationally, and how Europe is affected by global developments.

## About

The first part of the course investigates Europe in the world from a system level. You will focus on global governance, the EU as a global actor and power shifts in the international system.

The second part of the course pursues a thematic analysis of three core concepts: security, trade and migration. You will study these concepts across time and international political and economic systems. Among others, you will be working with issues regarding security and the security strategies of European states and institutions; the European financial crisis and the changing presence of Europe in the global political economy; and the impact of international migration on European societies and states.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The requirement for admission to the course is a Bachelor's degree with a minimum of 90 higher education credits in a social science discipline or a humanities discipline. Students at the Law programme are also eligible to apply to the course, after three years (180 higher education credits, equivalent of a bachelor degree). Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

After finishing this course, you will have in depth-knowledge of how Europe’s role in the world has developed and how Europe’s presence in the international political and economic systems can be conceived.
