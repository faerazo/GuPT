## Summary

This is an in-depth course in biology and environmental science that is aimed at those who wish to supplement and deepen their knowledge in ecotoxicology mainly at cellular and individual level but it also covers some aspects at molecular and population level as well. It is an experimental course and intends to provide insight into various ecotoxicological tests, including such used for monitoring the environment. The course is aimed at both the aquatic and the terrestrial environment.

## About

The course deals with toxicological and ecotoxicological principles, measurement methods, effects and mechanisms of action with an emphasis on the individual level, as well as testing for sublethal toxic effects such as changes in growth, reproduction and tissue damage.

The course also addresses toxic effects at the suborganism level. It includes studies of changes in gene expression such as enzymes and metabolites and associated functions and regulation. The intention is to provide knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of toxic substances. Effects at the superorganism level include changes in phenotype and genotype, as well as physiological fitness of the individuals in a population.

The course is experimental and intends to provide insight into various ecotoxicological tests, including such tests that are used for monitoring the environment. The course is aimed at both aquatic and terrestrial environment. The course will also provide an orientation on the sources of environmental toxins, transport, distribution, degradation and final destination in the environment.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

At least 90 credits in natural sciences (biology, chemistry, ecology, earth, environmental, marine sciences), with a minimum of 30 credits in biology and 30 credits in chemistry, or 60 credits in biology. These prerequisites can be waived if an applicant has verifiable equivalent knowledge/skills. The course ES1305, 15 credits can be counted as biology or chemistry.

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish upper secondary school. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B).
