## Summary

The course gives an introduction to comparative historical language studies.

## About

We study effects of language contact such as language change and variation, linguistic contact fields and loans based on African languages. We discuss, among other things, phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic change. In most cases, the type of written documentation that is available for many other languages is not available for African languages and this makes linguistic reconstruction even more important

**The course has scheduled online classes primarily daytime.**

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The requirement for admission to the course is as follows: (A) a Bachelor's degree in a language or general linguistics in which an individual project of at least 15 credits should be included; (B) English 6/IELTS 6.5/TOEFL 580, in all parts, or the equivalent thereof.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation
