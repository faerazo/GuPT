## Summary

The course is designed for students that have studied environmental science and want to learn how to carry out hands on environmental work. The course aims to provide skills in designing and implementing an environmental management system (EMS), such as the worldwide very common ISO14001, including environmental auditing. Also the European version EMAS is addressed. After the course, the student is well trained to either implement an EMS in a company/organization or work as an auditor checking such systems.

## About

The idea of an environmental system , as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks are presented. The ISO 14001 and EMAS standards are addressed in detail. Experienced lecturers from the business sector are invited to share their practical experiences. Exercises of different practical items like e.g. formulating objectives, planning an audit, writing a non-conformity, are important activities to help the students to become more “hands-on”.

Half of the course constitutes a project carried out in smaller groups for a real company/organization. The project consists of writing an environmental review including identifying the company’s environmental aspects, making a legislation list, a risk and opportunity assessment and a stakeholder analysis. Furthermore, an environmental policy, a set of objectives, one procedure and an audit plan are written. The global GRI-Standards system for writing a sustainability report is also a part of the course. The project work can be carried out elsewhere than in Gothenburg. But then the student must on its own find a company/organization to work at.
