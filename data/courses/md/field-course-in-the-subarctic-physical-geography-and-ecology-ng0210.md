## Summary

The Earth's climate is changing. The effects are above all evident in sensitive areas such as the Arctic, a region that also has a major impact on the global climate. This course will help you understand what is happening in the Arctic with a focus on subarctic.

The course includes an excursion to Abisko and Saarikoski in northern Sweden.

## About

The Field Course in the Subarctic - Physical Geography and Ecology aims to describe climate and landscape changes in the Subarctic, as well as the effects of climate change, Arctic mechanisms and vegetation patterns in the Scandinavian mountain range.

The course consists of three modules:

**1\. Theory**

This module aims to deepen your knowledge of the changes occurring in the Arctic, with a focus on the subarctic, and potential feedbacks to the global climate. The course covers a wide range of topics to provide a broad understanding of climate change in the subarctic, past and present:

- High-Latitude climates
- Arctic climate change and feedbacks
- Biogeochemical processes in the Arctic
- Glaciology
- Subarctic landscapes
- Vegetation

**2\. Field studies**

The module includes a two week excursion. You will learn:

- about alpine vegetation zonation and plants characterizing alpine and arctic environments.
- to define characteristic landscape features.
- to acquire practical experience in methods used to interpret changes in the landscape and climate .


The field trip has extra costs for you as a student. If you are a programme student, you can apply for a scholarship from the Adlerbertska Foundations.

[Read more about Adlerbert scholarships](https://studentportal.gu.se/english/help-and-guidance/finances/scholarships-and-grants/?selectedSegment=the-adlerbert-scholarships&languageId=100001&skipSSOCheck=true&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gu.se%2F).

**3\. Group project**

Group project within the fields of Physical Geography and Ecology. The projects build on data collected during the excursion. Results will be presented orally and in writing.

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- excursion
- lectures
- mandatory lab work
- mandatory seminars
- group project
- presentations

Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Qualifications corresponding to 60 credits in Earth Sciences, Geography, Environmental Sciences or Biology.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you study Earth Science, you have good career opportunities both in Sweden and abroad. You can choose to work in industry, as a consultant, project manager or in public administration.

Our former students work, for example, with natural resource management, environmental issues and urban planning, you also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.
