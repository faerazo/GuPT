## Position

The course is a core course in Political Science and given as a single subject course. It can also be a part of the Programme in Political Science and the Programme in Environmental Social Science (SMIL). The course is also given as a single subject course for international exchange students.

## Entry requirements

General entrance requirements.


## Content

The overarching goal of the course is to develop theoretical understanding in order to analyze environmental policy challenges from the perspective of political science.

The course is based on different thematic areas. Each theme includes an introductory lecture, independent study, and analysis/reflection in the form of a discussion seminar.

The discussion seminars are based around student presentations on pre-assigned research topics. Each student is expected to prepare a presentation for one seminar, and to participate actively in the others. The course concludes with an exam.

The course is suitable for students who are preparing upcoming theses within the field of environmental policy, but is also aimed at students who are interested in gaining a broad, research-based understanding of environmental policy in general.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

**Knowledge and understanding**

- Describe challenges to environmental policy based on theoretical approaches within political science.
- Describe how factors at different levels (individual, national and international level) affect the design and implementation of environmental policy.

**_Competence and skills_**

- Explain how theoretical perspectives from political science can be applied to environmental policy challenges.
- Communicate clearly and proficiently, both orally and in writing.

**Judgement and approach**

- Discuss, compare and apply different theoretical approaches to environmental policy challenges.
- Participate in discussions, actively and independently, with fellow students regarding various political science theories included in the course.

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-focused, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg’s confirmed sustainability criteria. The content also constitutes the course's main focus.


## Form of teaching

The teaching consists of lectures and seminars.

_Language of instruction:_ English or Swedish

This course may be offered in Swedish or English. If the course is held in Swedish, certain literature or lectures may be held in English.

## Examination formats

The course is examined through written assignments, a mandatory seminar presentation, and an exam.

Compensatory completion of examined assignments are permitted. If the student does not submit the completion on time, the student will be failed on the assignment.

A student who is not able to present at the compulsory oral seminar is permitted to do an alternative assignment.

If a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for study support for students with disabilities, the examiner may, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, decide to allow the student to complete an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).

In cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).

To receive a grade of Pass for the course, students must have passed all required components of the course. This entails adequate completion of written assignments, a seminar presentation, and a grade of Pass on the exam.

For the grade of Pass with Distinction, students need to fulfill the requirements for the grade Pass, and in addition a grade of Pass with Distinction on the exam.

## Course evaluation

Students will be given the opportunity to complete a course evaluation. Results of, and possible changes from, the evaluation will be shared with students after the course is completed.
