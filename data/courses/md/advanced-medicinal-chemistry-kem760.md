## About

The course in Advanced Medicinal Chemistry will provide in-depth knowledge of the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of small organic substances as potential lead compounds.

After completing the course, you should be able to

- describe strategies for the design and synthesis of potential lead compounds
- explain important methods and theories for the design and synthesis of lead compounds
- describe methods for biological evaluation of substances
- use computer-based methods (computational chemistry) to design potential lead compounds and to study and solve drug-chemical problems
- perform basic retro-synthetic analysis
- propose synthetic methods for drug substances
- explain important methods and theories for evaluation of lead compounds and apply them to specific cases
- critically analyse scientific publications
- explain and discuss your conclusions, as well as the knowledge and arguments that underlie them, both orally and in writing.

The knowledge obtained in this course is necessary for continued higher studies in medicinal chemistry.

### Teaching

The course is divided into lectures, group exercises, project assignments, computer labs and literature seminars. Group exercises, project assignments, computer labs and seminars are mandatory.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

90 credits in chemistry, including KEM815, Advanced Organic Chemistry (15 credits) and KEM825, Organic Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry (10 credits) or equal qualifications. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)
- Master's programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (N2KEL).

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

After completion of your education, you can work in different types of chemistry companies, food companies or analysis and synthesis laboratories, with laboratory work as well as research and development.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
