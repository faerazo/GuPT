## About

Bioanalytical chemistry - from single molecules to tissues is a course for you who wants to learn more about biological applications of analytical chemistry. The course provides in-depth knowledge within bioanalytical chemistry with specialization in molecular structure techniques, chemical analysis across tissues, cell and subcellular molecular analysis, and protein analysis.

The theoretical and laboratory parts of the course are closely connected to current research and prepare you for a degree project in chemistry, neurobiochemistry, molecular biology or analytical chemistry. After the course, you will be well prepared to do further research studies in these subjects.

### Teaching

The course content is delivered through a series of lectures and several laboratory classes with experiments, both hands-on and by observation. You are expected to report your laboratory results in oral or written form to develop your communication skills.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection
