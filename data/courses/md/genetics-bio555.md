## About

Genetics is a course at the advanced level and provides deeper knowledge of several genetics topics, including all or some of the following:

- Simple and complex inheritance
- Genetic linkage and mapping in eukaryotes
- Variations in chromosome structure and numbers
- Gene mutations and DNA repair
- Transposons and selfish DNA
- Developmental biology
- Quantitative genetics
- Populations genetics
- Evolutionary genetics.

After completion of the course, you are expected to have acquired the following competences:

- Know and understand key concepts in genetics, such as heritability, gene mapping and identification, genetic variation.
- Be able to read and understand scientific literature in the field of genetics.
- Be able to orally present genetics articles to peers.
- Be able to write a laboratory report in the style of a research article.
- Be able to maintain _C. elegans_ strains and characterize their phenotypes.
- Be able to design a gene mapping strategy in _C. elegans_.
- Be able to critically judge the import of primary articles in the field of genetics.

### Teaching

Many parts of the course are built around an original primary research article. After the introduction of the article in its historical setting, the experimental setup and results are presented, interpreted and discussed in a modern context. A rather ambitious semi-independent laboratory exercise involving the mapping of mutations in the model organism C. elegans spans several weeks of the course. A written laboratory report and at least one oral presentation are also part of the course.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Approved basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology and biodiversity and systematics, or equivalent. English proficiency is required to the level of English 6/English Course B from Swedish Upper Secondary School, or be certified by an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS. In addition a completed depth course of 15 credits in a relevant area is also required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor’s programmes in Molecular Biology or in Biology
- Master’s programme in Molecular Biology
- Master’s programme in Biology
- Master’s programme in Genomics and Systems Biology.

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

This course helps you to understand the principles and methods of genetics. This is fundamental knowledge that will be useful in science-related careers. You can work with research in academia or industry, genetic counseling in the healthcare system or as a teacher at any level of education. You can also work in science museums, in governmental advisory functions, with marketing of bioscience-related products, among others.

This course also gives a solid foundation for continued studies towards a doctoral or medical degree.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
