The course can also be included in the master's programs in Atmospheric Science, Climate and Ecosystems (N2ACE), Ecotoxicology (N2TOX), Environmental and Health Protection (N2MIH), and Environmental Science (N2MVN), as well as being taken as a separate course.

## Entry requirements

120 credits in natural science (biology, earth science, chemistry, physics, environmental science-natural science) out of which at least 60 credits in environmental science-natural science or equivalent education. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish upper secondary school. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

## Content

The student carries out an internship at a workplace, for example at a company or authority, or carries out a scientifically structured investigation at the Department of Biology and Environmental Science or another department in the same subject area. Previously acquired knowledge in environmental science must be applied by the student. A supervisor must be available at the relevant location where the internship is carried out.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student is expected to:

• have a good insight into and good experiences of environmental work at a workplace (a company, an authority or an environmental organization)

• be able to take personal responsibility for planning and carrying out concrete environmental tasks at a workplace

• be able to present and discuss results from completed environmental work be able to apply the knowledge acquired from the environmental education in practical environmental work

• be able to produce and evaluate relevant knowledge for the implementation of environmental tasks at the workplace

• have gained experience of working and functioning together with colleagues with different skills

• feel well prepared and motivated to take the step into working life

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-focused, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg’s confirmed sustainability criteria. The content also constitutes the course's main focus.


## Form of teaching

The work should culminate in a thesis or a report in Swedish or English. Language of instruction: Swedish and English

## Examination formats

The work is assessed based on how the internship is conducted and through a written report. Detailed assessment criteria are available to the student at the start of the course.

If a student who has been failed twice for the same examination element wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be granted unless there are specific reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 HF).

If a student has received a certificate of disability study support from the University of Gothenburg with a recommendation of adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment, an examiner may decide, if this is consistent with the course’s intended learning outcomes and provided that no unreasonable resources would be needed, to grant the student adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment.

If a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be offered at least two examination sessions in addition to ordinary examination sessions. These sessions are to be spread over a period of at least one year but no more than two years after the course has been discontinued/changed. The same applies to placement and internship (VFU) except that this is restricted to only one further examination session.

If a student has been notified that they fulfil the requirements for being a student at Riksidrottsuniversitetet (RIU student), to combine elite sports activities with studies, the examiner is entitled to decide on adaptation of examinations if this is done in accordance with the Local rules regarding RIU students at the University of Gothenburg.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass (G) and Fail (U).

## Course evaluation

An opportunity is given to submit a written course evaluation at the end of the course. The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
