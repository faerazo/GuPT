## Course modules

Introduction to runes and runology, 7.5 Credits


## Entry requirements

General entrance requirements.


## Content

The course provides an introduction to runes and runology, with a focus on Swedish conditions. Theories about the origin of runic writing are discussed, and both the oldest runic inscriptions and medieval inscriptions are treated. An important element of the course is excursions to study runic monuments on site in the landscape, where each student presents a runic inscription.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

- Explain different theories about the origin of runes.
- Explain certain language changes from Proto-Norse to the Middle Ages that are important for understanding the language of runic inscriptions.
- Explain the differences between the older and younger runic alphabet (futhark).
- Explain the basic features of the Viking Age runic tradition.

_Competence and skills_

- read and translate the runic texts discussed in the course using relevant dictionaries, corpus editions, and databases,
- present a Viking Age runic inscription in an educational manner.

_Judgement and approach_

- Critically assess the interpretation of difficult-to-assess runic inscriptions in research literature.
- Approach popular scientific discussions about runes and runology in a scientific manner.

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

The course is given in the form of lectures, exercises, and practical interpretation moments.

A digital learning platform is used for communication between teachers and students as well as between students. Therefore, access to a computer and the internet is required.

Language of instruction: English during spring semesters and Swedish during autumn semesters.

## Examination formats

Examinations are conducted through active participation in mandatory activities and a final oral or written exam.

The examiner may allow for completion within an agreed-upon deadline for students who are deemed to be close to the passing grade. Absence from examination and/or mandatory activities can be fulfilled with assignments determined to be adequate by the examiner. (Replacement assignments may sometimes require the course participant to complete them after the formal end of the course.)

Only aids approved by the examiner may be used during the examination. This applies to both digital and analog aids, as well as collaboration.

If a student who has twice received a failing grade for the same examination component wishes to change examiner ahead of the next examination session, such a request should be made to the department in writing and should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher EducationÂ Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for study support for students with disabilities, the examiner may, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

In the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to internships and professional placements (VFU), although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).

In the course, one of the grades given is Very Good (VG), Pass (G), and Fail (U). The grade Very Good requires higher demands on analysis, problematization, and synthesis in relation to the course content, as well as on an independent approach and linguistic ability.

## Course evaluation

The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
