## About

In this course we will study the foundations of differential and integral calculus on smooth manifolds, along with applications of the theory in topology and geometry. One of the main purposes is to acquaint you with differential forms and their great usefulness in many areas of mathematics. The course is one of the first you will take as a graduate student in mathematics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of 90 credits in mathematics, including at least 7.5 credits from the second cycle.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
