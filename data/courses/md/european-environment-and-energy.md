## Position

The course is given within the Master's Programme in European Studies (two-year programme) and is a semi-elective course. The course is also an elective course for the Masterprogram Political Science and the Master's Programme in International Administration and Global Governance. The course is also an optional course for the completion of the Master's degree in Law. Students not enrolled in either of these programmes may attend this course as an independent course.

## Entry requirements

The requirement for admission to the course is a Bachelors degree with a minimum of 90 higher education credits in a social science discipline or a humanities discipline. Students at the Law programme are also eligible to apply to the course, after three years (180 higher education credits, equivalent of a bachelor degree). Priority will be given to applicants with 60 higher education credits in European Studies. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

## Content

The course addresses and problematizes European environmental and energy policy with a focus on sustainability and collective action. It explores a range of environmental and energy issues and future challenges in Europe, with specific topics influenced by student interests, for example the dynamics between the EU and its member states, the impact of NGOs and other lobby groups, and the EU's global role.

## Objectives

A student who has passed the course will be able to:

**Knowledge and understanding**

- demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the political conditions for environmental and energy policymaking in Europe.

**Competence and skills**

- analyze specific environmental and energy issues within the context of European policy.
- effectively present and advocate for own and independent analyses of European environmental and energy policies, both verbally and in written form.
- search for and critically summarize research literature concerning the study of European environmental and energy policies.
- formulate and argue for interesting research problems within the field of European environment and energy policy.
- independently produce text in accordance with good academic practice, including proper citation technique and use of references.
- communicate clearly and proficiently in English both orally and in writing.

**Judgement and approach**

- evaluate and criticize research results and theories investigating European environment and energy policy.
- take part in reflective discussions of existing research on European environment and energy policy.

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-focused, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg’s confirmed sustainability criteria. The content also constitutes the course's main focus.


## Form of teaching

The main forms of instruction are lectures and compulsory seminars that require active participation.

_Language of instruction:_ English

## Examination formats

Students will be evaluated based on their performance on four assignments. Assignments 1–3 are worth 3.5 credits each, while assignment 4 is worth 4.5 credits. Each assignment is evaluated with the grades “high pass” (VG), “pass” (G) or “fail” (U), and the grade is based on both the written paper and the performance at the seminar. In order to pass an assignment, the students have to actively participate at the seminar during the theme connected with the assignment as well as get pass on the written assignment.

Students can be asked to re-work graded assignments and re-submit them. If the student does not re-submit the reworked assignment on time, the student will be failed on the assignment.

A student who is not able to attend a compulsory part of the course can do an alternative assignment. The assignment will be described in the course guide.

If a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).

In cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given. This may not be in conflict with Chapter 6 Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: High pass (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U). To obtain the Pass grade (G) of the course, the student must receive a pass grade (G) on all assignments. To obtain High pass (VG), at least 50% (or 7,5 credits) of the course has to be graded as High pass (VG), while also passing all other assignments.

To obtain the Pass grade the student must therefore fulfil all the learning outcomes by actively participating in compulsory seminars as well as obtaining Pass on the written assignments. To obtain High pass the work of the student should, besides satisfying the requirements for the Pass grade, show a very good ability to connect theoretical perspectives to practical examples and a good, independent analytical ability. In addition, to obtain High pass the student’s written assignment must fulfil high academic standards in terms of structure and language.

## Course evaluation

The student will be given the opportunity to do a course evaluation. The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
