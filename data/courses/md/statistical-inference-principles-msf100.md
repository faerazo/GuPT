## About

The course is intended for students of the second year of master studies. This course takes an advanced and rigorous look at mathematical statistics and approaches to inference. In addition to covering central concepts and models of statistics, differing philosophical perspectives on scientific inference are discussed and compared.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The prerequisite for the course MSF100 is the equivalent of the course MSG 200 Statistical inference or MSA840 Statistics and data analysis plus at least two of the courses (or similar) MSA100 Computer intensive statistical methods MSA630 Survival analysis MSA650 Linear mixed models for longitudinal data MSA200 Multivariate statistical analysis MSA250 Experimental design MSA600 Statistics in genetics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms.
