## About

The aim of the course is to provide you with knowledge of data analysis for Earth Sciences:

- Basic statistical measures and tests, such as statistical significance, graphs, confidence intervals, etc.
- Elementary coding.
- Scientific writing: how to describe and summarize results, how to write a caption.
- How to select appropriate data analysis methods for geological, hydrological and climate-related data

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Earth Sciences and is a compulsory course. The course is also offered as a freestanding course.
