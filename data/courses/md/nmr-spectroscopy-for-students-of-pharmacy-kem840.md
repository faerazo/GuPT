## About

The course NMR spectroscopy for Students of Pharmacy aims to give you advanced and expanded knowledge of NMR-spectroscopic methods that are used in pharmaceutical research for identification and structure elucidation of medicinal substances, for estimation of their purity and for study of their interactions with proteins.

The course includes the following subjects:

- Vector model in NMR Spectroscopy
- Relaxation mechanisms in NMR Spectroscopy
- Practical aspects on NMR Spectroscopy (sample preparation, data collection, data analysis)
- One-dimensional NMR-techniques
- Homonuclear NMR-techniques (COSY, TOCSY)
- Heteronuclear NMR-techniques (HSQC, HMBC)
- Correlations in 3D (NOESY)
- Diffusion-NMR-spectroscopy
- Structural analysis of bioactive natural products
- Purity determination of sample

On successful completion of the course, you should be able to

- account one-dimensional (1D) and advanced two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods such as COSY, NOESY, ROESY, HSQC, HMBC and analyze the respective spectra
- predict NMR data for medicinal organic compounds
- identify the adequate NMR methods that are used to decide structure of medicinal molecules, their purity and interaction with proteins

- prepare NMR-samples
- decide structure of medicinal small molecules by means of NMR-spectroscopic technology
- decide purity of substances by means of NMR-spectroscopic methods
- identify protein binding of small molecules by means of NMR Spectroscopy
- interpret 1D and 2D NMR-spectra

- assess purity of NMR-samples
- assess usability of different NMR-methods to solve a structure decide purity or analyse protein interactions.

### Teaching

Teaching comprises lectures, group seminars and laboratory classes. The group seminars and laboratory classes are mandatory.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

90 credits within Pharmacy/Medicine or 75credits in chemistry including KEM011, Basic chemistry 1 (15 credits), KEM021, Basic chemistry 2 (15 credits) and KEM031, Organic chemistry (15 credits). Students with equal qualifications can be admitted.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

NMR Spectroscopy for Students of Pharmacy is an elective course in the Pharmacy Programme.

After the course, you can work in the pharmaceutical industry, analytical laboratories, and in the field of chemistry or chemical engineering. The course is also popular with graduate students in chemistry.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
