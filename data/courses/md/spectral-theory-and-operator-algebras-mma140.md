## About

In this course you will see a comprehensive treatment of the theory of linear operators on infinite-dimensional spaces. Our fundamental problem is to calculate spectra of specific operators. The spectrum of bounded operators on Banach spaces is best studied within the context of Banach and in particular C^\*-algebras, and a part of the course will be devoted to the theory of these algebras. You will also learn about the spectral theorem for normal operators and the Riesz theory of compact operators with applications.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of the course MMA120 Functional Analysis.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
