## About

The course will provide an understanding of the ocean processes that impact its motion (e.g. circulation and property exchange) and the scales that they occur, that are relevant for 21st century science. The course will attempt to have a overall view of the ocean, in the sense that a number of oceanic domains will be incorporated and taught on. The course will cover the importance of the different scales that processes occur in space and time, such as from micro-scale mixing processes to the larger mesoscale flows.

The course will include a field work element, where students are expected to take the knowledge from the course to design a small field experiment using a research ship and scientific equipment/sensors. The students will then use the collected field observations to complete simple tasks in analyzing and interpreting the data.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

120 credits in the field of Science where at least 60 credits must be in the fields of Mathematics, Physics, Physical Oceanography, Meteorology or equivalent knowledge. Alternatively; Bachelor's Degree (180 credits) in Marine Sciences, including 15 credits within Physical Oceanography or equivalent knowledge. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities
