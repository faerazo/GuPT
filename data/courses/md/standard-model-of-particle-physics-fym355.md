## Summary

To present the Standard Model of particle physics, which is a quantum field theory describing how the known elementary particles interact via the electromagnetic, weak and strong force. A key element in this theory is the Higgs mechanism, and the associated Higgs particle.

## About

The purpose of the course is to provide the students with a working knowledge of the basic concepts and features of the Standard Model, including its of predictions (which have been verified with unprecedented accuracy) as well as its experimental and theoretical shortcomings.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelors degree in physics or equivalent. Recommended:Introductory course in Quantum Field Theory

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
