## Summary

The course is for you who are interested in hazardous substances and their effects in the environment including biological communities and ecosystems. You will get both a theoretical basis in ecotoxicology with emphasis on ecology and experience of different experimental methods, including field sampling. If you are an environmental scientist or biologist that want to work with issues relating to chemicals at a company, as a consultant or at an authority this is a course for you.

## About

This course in ecotoxicology focus on effects of hazardous chemicals in the environment and what happens with biological communities of diverse organisms, both in a short- and long-term perspective. The course connects to the UN sustainability goals no.13 Climate, 14 Life under water, and 15 Life on land.

We go through ecotoxicological principles, approaches and methods with focus on the function, structure and ecology of communities. This will provide you with a scientific basis for the more applied aspects of ecotoxicology, and insight to pros and cons with different strategies. We cover both aquatic and terrestrial examples, but with emphasis on the aquatic environment. Combination effects is another central theme, both as combinations of hazardous substances and as hazardous substances in combination with other impacts such as eutrophication and ocean acidification.

Laboratory work is a part of the course with examples of different methodologies, including field sampling and model communities. You will also get experience of presenting studies and results in a scientific and popular scientific context.

One week at Kristineberg Marine Research Station is often included, where the experiments are strongly connected to on-going research, and the working days can be long. Normally we also include a poster session during the stay. Please note that there are costs for travel and meals for the stay at Kristineberg.

In the open pages on Canvas you can find the public course information to the course by entering the course code (BIO430) for the course in the search field on canvas.gu.se/search/all\_courses/ and press search.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

At least 90 credits in natural sciences (biology, chemistry, ecology, earth-, environmental-, marine sciences) with a minimum of 30 credits in biology and 30 credits in chemistry, or 60 credits in biology. These prerequisites can be waived if an applicant has verifiable equivalent knowledge/skills. The course ES1305, 15 credits can be counted within the requested 90 credits above. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish upper secondary school. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B). Field sampling for the laboratory work involves visits to other locations in the Gothenburg area. We usually spend part of the course at the Kristineberg marine research station outside Fiskebäckskil for an intense week of field- and laboratory work. The stay at Kristineberg is associated with a cost for travel and meals.
