Cultural perspectives on Gender and Families, 7.5 Credits


## Entry requirements

General entrance requirements.


## Content

On the course, beliefs and norms about family and nationality are examined and discussed. An important starting point is how family is given meaning in relation to the construction of nationality. Sweden is at the center, but during the course digressions and comparisons are made with other countries and nation formations historically and today. Some of the themes that are addressed are how family and parenting is constantly transformed, equality norms and queer perspectives on family become important inputs here, as well as how ideas about the Swedish family create ideas about "the Others", those who are not included in the imagined national community. The situation of families with migration experience is highlighted.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

\\* Explain different concepts and norms about family in a Swedish and transnational context.

\\* Account for changes and stabilizations of understanding of parenthood in a Swedish context.

_Competence and skills_

\\* Describe and analytically approach the relationship between the creation of nation and norms of family.

\\* Have an understanding of the importance of theoretical perspectives for how knowledge about family can become visible.
