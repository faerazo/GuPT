## About

In this course you will learn about string theory and the fundamental questions about nature that can only be answered using strings. The course  discusses the fundamental problems encountered when trying to understand our universe in terms of standard (quantum) field theory methods of elementary particle physics, and how string theory may solve them. String theory is introduced and quantized in the most simple way possible and with a minimum of mathematics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
