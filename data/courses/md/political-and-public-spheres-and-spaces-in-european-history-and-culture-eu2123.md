## Summary

This course is about public, private and secret spheres in the European past and present. We will discuss the differences between public, political and private spheres through a historical perspective and until the present.

## About

Squares, palaces, cafés, and social media – spheres of power, protest, and deliberation. The Political and Public Spheres and Spaces in European History and Culture course problematizes the emergence and political significance of the public sphere and its’ relation to the private and secret spheres in European past and present.

By tracing the forms of ‘public sphere’ from its Greek & Roman origins, through medieval and early modern palaces and ceremonies, into such modern phenomena such as mass protests, state censorship, inclusive/exclusory planning of urban space, scientific debate, and digital piracy the course offers a comprehensive view on politics as a sphere of contention and opinion formation.

The course delivers a carefully chosen array of perspectives of different humanist disciplines with teachers recruited from a broad range of subjects. Representatives from different academic disciplines will participate in the course as teachers, which provides students with insights into the theoretical and practical experiences of different fields within European studies.
