## Summary

In this course you will gain in-depth knowledge of how and why European welfare states, policies, and social citizenship vary across different parts of Europe. You will learn about the diversity and development of European social systems and how they affect gender, work, identity, and migration. The course also problematizes the relation between policymaking at the EU level and the member states.

## About

The course seeks to consider the past, present, and future of Social Europe. It will focus on inter-disciplinary aspects of the European citizenship, i.e. rights and obligations, work, family, gender, identity, immigration and the future of European welfare states. You will get in-depth knowledge of the diversity of European social policies, of their political background and of current welfare reforms. The course addresses and problematizes European social policy and law. This provides the baseline for thematic elaborations on different social problems and future challenges for the EU, including analyses of the relation between the EU, the Council of Europe and the member states.
