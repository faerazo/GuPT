## Summary

How can a salmon migrate between freshwater and sea water? How can a periwinkle survive the sea ice? Is mussel culture good for more than Moules marinière? This course is aimed for you who are interested in finding out more about how different mainly marine animals react to and adapt to changes in their environment. The course also illustrates how you can apply your basic physiological knowledge when it comes to potential problems in marine aquaculture. The course follows the educational model Problem Based Learning (PBL).

## About

The course aims to provide broad and in-depth knowledge of comparative physiology from a marine perspective at the cell, organ and organism level. The focus is on the marine environment and how different organisms react to the environment and how they respond to it with the help of nervous and hormonal control systems and what happens if the environment changes for either natural reasons or caused by man. The course aims to apply basic physiological knowledge to potential problems in marine aquaculture.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

University studies of a minimum of 75 credits in Biology and Molecular Biology/Cellbiology with at least one in depth course of 15 credits in a relevant area. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B).

## Recommended study route

The course applies Problem based learning, centred around a supervised student learning group, but do also contain lectures, seminars and several advanced practicals illustrating modern techniques and problem solving. The last third of the course is dedicated to a longer project work in which the student uses their acquired theoretical and practical knowledge. The students will do oral as well as written presentations of the outcome of their projects.
