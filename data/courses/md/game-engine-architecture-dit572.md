## About

The design and implementation of the fundamental components of a game engine is the core of the Game Engine Architecture course. The course focuses mainly upon 2-dimensional games although other types of game engines are discussed, and students wishing to explore 3D game engines can do so as part of the assignment. During the course we will develop an example game engine which includes several of the key aspects of professional game engine systems.

The course will cover timing regulation, game object architecture, collision action, collision responses, and some simple physics. It will also discuss relevant design decisions and design patterns. It is not expected during this course that you will develop a feasible competitor for what is on the market. Rather, the process of building a game engine is intended to be illuminating when developing games in more robust engines.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for this course, students must have either:

\- successfully completed the course Computer Graphics, 7.5 credits, or equivalent, or

\- have 15 credits of programming experience, of which 7.5 of those credits should be in an object-oriented context.

Applicants must prove knowledge of English: English 6/English B or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits
