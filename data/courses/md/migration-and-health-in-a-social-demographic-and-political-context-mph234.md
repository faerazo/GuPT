## Summary

The course will provide the students with a basic knowledge on fundamental concepts and global agreements around the rights of migrants, including their right to health.

Based on available research the course will look into bio-psycho-social mechanisms between the migration process and physical and mental health.

The course will also discuss the heterogeneity in the group of migrants and discuss potential preventive and promotive interventions on different levels.

## About

The course will acknowledge potential differences in these mechanisms based on the heterogeneity among migrants based on for example social position (i.e. intersectionality) and discuss how potential interventions and policies could prevent disease and promote health in different groups of migrants, including the association between integration and health. Based on the extent of the area of migration and health the students will have the opportunity to choose a specific setting (e.g. country, health outcome, group of migrants) for more in-depth learning in line with previous experience and/or current interest.
