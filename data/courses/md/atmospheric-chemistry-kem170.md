## About

Chemistry is everywhere, even in the air you breathe. Understanding atmospheric chemistry is important to describe how natural and man-made gaseous air pollutants are produced, transformed or removed from the atmosphere.

The course Atmospheric Chemistry gives you a deep understanding of the chemistry that takes place in the atmosphere and explains its resulting effects on the environment. We put the main emphasis on processes in the lower atmosphere, but the stratosphere and indoor air quality are also treated. You will learn how photochemical reactions initiate oxidation of natural and anthropogenic compounds in the air and how to treat such reactions quantitatively. Practical reaction kinetics, reaction mechanisms and experimental methods are also covered in this course.

Atmospheric chemistry is to a large extent an applied science that is developing fast in parallel with the transformation of the society causing changes in atmospheric composition. Therefore, the teachers continuously update the course content in order to give you the latest developments in the research field.

This course is ideal for you who wants to combine chemistry and environmental issues in your professional life. It is one of the courses within the themes of environmental chemistry.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The admission requirements are 90 credits within science including KEM050, Inorganic chemistry, 15 credits or equivalent education.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor’s programme in Chemistry (N1KEM)
- Bachelor’s programme in Environmental Science (N1MVN)
- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)
- Master's programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (N2KEL)
- Master’s programme in Chemistry and learning (N2KOL)
- Master’s programme in Atmosphere, Climate and Ecosystems (N2ACE)
- Master’s programme in Environmental Sciences (N2MVN)

This course can also fit in in a profile with analytical or physical chemistry focus.

You can find a job within research and development with focus on environmental chemistry.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
