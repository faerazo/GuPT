## Course modules

Biodiversity – patterns and processes – project, 5 Credits


## Position

The course is aen electable course in the master program in biology. The course complements the course Biodiversity - patterns and processes.

## Entry requirements

This course requires completion of biodiversity – patterns and processes (BIO411)

## Content

This course offers students the change to gain a deeper understanding of the processes discussed in “Biodiversity – patterns and processes”. Under guidance by a teacher the student will prepare a report combining parts from at least two of the six tropics discussed in the previous course. The report will mainly be theoretical in nature but should also contain some data analytical parts.

## Objectives

Upon completed course, the student will be able to:

-find relevant scientific literature

-with guidance perform analysis of scientific data concerning biodiversity patterns

-put one’s own results into a wider scientific context

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

The course consists of independent work under supervision that develops one of the six questions introduced in the course Biodiversity – Patterns and Processes (BIO411)

The course is given in English.

## Examination formats

Students are required to hand in a project report of approximately 10 pages that will be evaluated according to criteria made available on the courses digital learning platform.

If a student who has been failed twice for the same examination element wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be granted unless there are specific reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 HF).

If a student has received a certificate of disability study support from the University of Gothenburg with a recommendation of adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment, an examiner may decide, if this is consistent with the course’s intended learning outcomes and provided that no unreasonable resources would be needed, to grant the student adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment.

If a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be offered at least two examination sessions in addition to ordinary examination sessions. These sessions are to be spread over a period of at least one year but no more than two years after the course has been discontinued/changed. The same applies to placement and internship (VFU) except that this is restricted to only one further examination session.

If a student has been notified that they fulfil the requirements for being a student at Riksidrottsuniversitetet (RIU student), to combine elite sports activities with studies, the examiner is entitled to decide on adaptation of examinations if this is done in accordance with the Local rules regarding RIU students at the University of Gothenburg.

## Course evaluation

The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
