## About

Selected early Jewish and rabbinical texts are studied. We focus on

texts from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Mishnah, Tosefta, Midrashim, and the

Babylonian as well as the Palestinian Talmud. Early principles for text

interpretation such as pesher, midrash, pardes, florilegia, are in focus

which involves analysis of texts in which these text interpretation

principles are used.

The course provides you with the knowledge and

tools needed to carry out a critical study of these texts and guides you

in the explanation and analysis of selected pericopes.

The course also

touches on the importance of knowledge of these principles of

interpretation for the understanding of exegesis of the Hebrew Bible and

the New Testament as well as for Jewish-Christian relations.
