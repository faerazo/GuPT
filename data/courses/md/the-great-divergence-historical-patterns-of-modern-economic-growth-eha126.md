Why do certain countries develop while others struggle to do so? Has it always been the case? If you are interested in a course that combines practical and theoretical approaches to growth and development from a global perspective, this course is for you.

## About

The course aims to explain global patterns of economic growth from a long-term perspective, with the intention to show when, where and how diverging patterns of growth emerged across the world, a phenomenon known as ’The Great Divergence’. The course discusses issues of measurement, timing and causes for the rise of the West and the decline of the rest.

### Selection
