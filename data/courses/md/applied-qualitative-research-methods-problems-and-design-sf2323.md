## About

This course will give you practical training in qualitative research methods, including data-collection, design, formulation of research problems, and methods for analysis of material. The course gives an initial overview over available research methods, their connection to theory, as well as research ethics.

The course is divided into blocks: 1) Research question and design, and 2) Analyzing data.

In each block, introductory lectures are followed by assignments where students apply the themes discussed. This structure offers the students the opportunity to learn more about qualitative research methods in general, but also to get hands-on experience of strength and weaknesses of different qualitative techniques. Students work together in groups which facilitate peer learning. Assignments are discussed in teacher-led small group seminars. The course end with a third block where students work on an individual paper focusing on their own research interest.

You will develop your methodological skills through case-based practices in seminars. In one part of the course, methods and design problems are introduced and practiced in lectures and seminars. In the second part of the course, students apply knowledge of research design and methods on their own research interests, and produce a research proposal as final product.

The course focuses in-depth on several different methodological approaches relevant for qualitative research in the social sciences and humanities, with an emphasis on text based analytical methods. You will learn how to identify and assess ethical problems relevant for qualitative research and evaluate as well as independently formulate clear arguments concerning the relationship between theory and method, and apply arguments to a particular case.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course the student should have obtained a pass grade on a 15 credits from asecond cycle core course in the social sciences, or the equivalent.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

After completed this course, you will know how to demonstrate an in-depth

understanding of concepts relevant for qualitative research, including concepts

such as interpretation, subjectivity, reflexivity and interrelated objectivity.

You will also have a deeper understanding on how to evaluate and argue for the

fit between the material and the method, and independently design research

using data collection methods, such as interviews, basic digital text analysis

and manual collection of written and digital data.
