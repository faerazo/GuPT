The course is also offered as a single subject course. The course is an in-depth course in Political Science in the second cycle.

## Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires 15 credits at the second cycle from the course SK2121 'Political Science Analysis' or a minimum of 15 credits from courses the first semester in the Master's Programme in European Studies or Master's Programme in International Administration and Global Governance.

## Content

This course discusses theories of democracy and autocracy, and confronts these theories with different approaches to measuring such phenomena across time and space.

Students are exposed to a range of theories of democratization, autocratization, democratic and autocratic stability, and they are trained in how to systematically analyze and evaluate such theories.

The course thus addresses the two interlinked topics of conceptualizing and measuring democracy and autocracy; and explaining of democratization and autocratization, as well as autocratic stability. It approaches these topics in a theoretically guided manner and with an emphasis on methodological challenges. It makes extensive use of both qualitative and quantitate data, including the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) database ( [https://v-dem.net](https://v-dem.net)). Finally, the course provides a learning experience communicating scientific findings to, and giving policy advise, to policy-makers/practitioners.

## Objectives

A student who has passed the course will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding:_

- Compare existing theories and empirical approaches to analyze democracy, autocracy, democratization, and autocratization
- Select appropriate writing skills to develop academic and policy texts in the area of regime stability and change
- Execute small-scale tasks to create unique datasets on democracy using the DEMSCORE national infrastructure

_Competence and skills_

- Evaluate regime stability and transformation by using all three of the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) datasets ( [https://v-dem.net](https://v-dem.net)).
- Formulate research ideas and policy advises by using a variety of writing and oral exposition approaches for research
- Produce a small-scale research and policy projects in the areas of democracy, autocracy, democratization, and/or autocratization, within a given time frame.

_Judgment and approach_

- Identify patterns of regime transformation in contemporary politics using case studies
- Assess strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to measurement of different concepts of democracy, autocracy, and regime transformation
- Develop approaches on actionable practices to foster democratization and strengthen democratic resilience

## Examination formats

**First assessment:** multiple-choice exam on the parts of the course literature covered in class so far, taken in class at an occasion with compulsory attendance. The assessment is done on a scale from 1 to 10 where scores 8-10 is equal to VG, 5-7 is equivalent to G, and lower than 5 is U. It is worth 3 credits.

**Second assessment:** groups of students’ oral presentation on a research question provided by the teacher. The group presentation is followed by a discussion with the teacher and other students. The seminar is compulsory, and absence is associated with a written make-up assignment. The assessment is done on a scale from 1 to 10 where scores 6-10 is equivalent to G, and lower than 6 is U. The group presentation is worth 3 credits.

**Third assessment:** students are asked to select a research question among those listed for group presentations (students can thus chose to write on the same topic as their own group presented on, or one of the other topics listed) and write a policy brief. Examples of policy briefs are found here on the V-Dem website: [https://v-dem.net/pb.html](https://v-dem.net/pb.html). The policy brief assignment is max 2,000 words inclusive of references, and tables and figures, and must be handed in on time. As make-up for not submitting on time, students need to write about two additional pages (so around 3,000 words in total instead of the max. 2,000 in the original assignment). The assessment is done on a scale from 1 to 10 where scores 8-10 is equal to VG, 5-7 is equivalent to G, and lower than 5 is U. The policy brief is worth 3 credits.

**Fourth assessment** is an independent student paper for the course. Course papers should address an issue central to the content of the class. The model for a paper is the introduction, theory, methods and data-sections of an academic article published in an established, peer-review journal such as the articles assigned as readings for the class. Students are not asked to empirically test the argument for the final paper. The length should not be less than 5,000 and not exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of references and appendices.

**Notes on assignments**

1. Restrictions on the use of generative AI are stated in the course guide. Students are obliged to inform themselves about the current rules for examining elements such as assignments, seminar papers and other forms of exams in the course in question.
2. Students can be asked to re-work assignments if the grade is “fail” (U) and re-submit them.
3. A student who is not able to attend a mandatory part of the course will be asked to complete a make-up assignment.
4. A student who has taken two exams in a course or part of a course without obtaining a pass grade is entitled to the nomination of another examiner. The student needs to contact the department for a new examiner, preferably in writing, and this should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).
5. If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.
6. At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).
7. If a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years, after the course has ceased/been changed.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).

Should a student fail to hand in the course paper on time by the first hand-in option at the end of the course, a late submission can maximum generate a Pass grade. In order to obtain a Pass with Distinction after the original submission date, a new topic have to be selected by the student in consultation with one of the teachers for submission at a later date and that paper must be completed within approximately the same time period that students have for the paper during the course period. The assessment is done on a scale from 1 to 10 where scores 8-10 is equal to VG, 5-7 is equivalent to G, and lower than 5 is U. The final course paper is worth 6 credits.

To obtain the Pass grade for the course as a whole, students must achieve at least a Pass grade on all four graded assignments.

In order to get the grade Pass with Distinction, students must achieve Pass with Distinction on at least one of the multiple-choice exam or the policy brief paper assignment and a Pass on the group presentation, attend all the seminars and workshops or complete make-up assignments, and finally receive Pass with Distinction on the final course paper.

Pass with Distinction requires that the work of the student demonstrate excellent knowledge on the main themes covered by the course, and also demonstrate very good skills to connect theory and empirical design and to fulfill high academic’s and policy practitioners’ standards in terms of structure and language, as well as demonstrate the ability to undertake the tasks within a predetermined time frame (i.e. submit on time).

## Course evaluation

The students will be given the opportunity evaluate the course. A summary of the course evaluation and reflections made by the course coordinator must be made available to the students within a reasonable period of time following completion of the course. The summary and any adjustments made in response to the evaluation shall be presented the next time the course is offered.
