## Summary

This course offers a multi-perspective survey of contemporary photographic culture and of new practice-based research on photography. This is an advanced-level course intended for students who wish to deepen their knowledge and develop a critically reflective attitude towards photography as a lens-based medium from both contemporary and historical perspectives.

## About

Based on current research projects, this course sheds light on how photography examines and expresses a number of today’s urgent issues and challenges, such as truth in an age characterized by resistance to facts, melting glaciers and other ecological catastrophes, decolonisation perspectives and strategies for bringing change to an inequitable world. A central aspect of the course is how photography relates to and thematicises its own heterogeneous history and the role that photography and photographic archives play in our interpretation and understanding of the past.

Photography and photographic research are in many cases multidisciplinary, and a series of lectures in this course will give students insight into how various professions – photographers, curators, editors and researchers – often work together. The invited lecturers work with photography, film, writing, exhibitions and other types of publication, which means that questions about circulation, networks and mediafication play a prominent role. Also central to the course is that photography is seen as part of a larger lens-based practice, and the goal is to give students a broader understanding of the medium of photography than one would get from a traditional history of photography. The course also includes that students formulate and discuss own proposals for an practice-based research projects.
