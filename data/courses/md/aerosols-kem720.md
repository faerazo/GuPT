## About

In this course, Aerosols, you will learn about the ubiquitous small particles found in air that are known as atmospheric aerosol particles. Aerosol particles are typically nanoscopic in scale and are a special category of colloids dispersed in gas that have significant environmental and health effects. They can also be generated for application in industry or medicine.

You will learn

- about the properties of these particles, where they come from, how they are formed and transformed in the earth’s atmosphere and how they can be generated in industrial applications. Aerosols represent a large fraction of the surface area available within the atmosphere, and those surfaces are quite often where important atmospheric chemistry and phase transitions occur.
- how you can count, measure, and quantify such particles and their environmental effects. In simple laboratory exercises you will use basic techniques to measure and characterize particles from the lab and from ambient air sampling.

This course is aimed at you if you are interested in developing an in-depth understanding of important physical and chemical processes relating to particles suspended in air, such as chemical reactions, nucleation, adsorption, diffusion, adhesion, cloud formation, light absorption and scattering. This course will also interest you if you are curious how aerosol science is linked to societal challenges such air pollution and climate change or if you want to learn about industrial applications such as nanotechnology and pharmaceutical drug delivery.

The course is given as a series of lectures, problem solving sessions and laboratory exercises, designed to provide you with a solid background for carrying out independent project work, for finding work or for pursuing further high-level studies within the field.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The admission requirement is passed degree in 45 credits within chemistry or equivalent education.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor’s programme in Chemistry (N1KEM)

- Bachelor’s programme in Medicinal Chemistry (N1LMK)

- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)

- Master's programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (N2KEL)

- Master’s programme in Atmosphere, Climate and Ecosystems (N2ACE)

- Master’s programme in Environmental Science (NMILM).

It can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

The course provides you with relevant background for applying for project work within physical chemistry and environmental science as well as for work within nanoparticles and pharmaceutical industries.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
