## About

Differential geometry is about curved manifolds. The course gives an introduction to curves and surfaces in two- and three-dimensional space.

The central concept is curvature. In the geometry of curved surfaces, geodesics play the role of straight lines in the plane as the locally shortest way between two points. At the end, we treat the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which connects the integral of the curvature with the topological properties of the surface.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to 60 credits in mathematics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
