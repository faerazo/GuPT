## Summary

In the course, a number of British novels in different genres and written during the Late Victorian period and later, down to the present day, are studied in order to discuss the role that money plays in them.

## About

By looking more closely at the historical contexts that have given rise

to the different ways in which money plays an importance in the novels,

the course shows how literature is a place where cultural importance is

added to the objective meaning of money.

The aim of the course is both

to show how fictitious statements contribute to the general public's

understanding of economics and how our understanding of money in turn is

central for how we create literary meaning. In this way, the course

facilitates further discussion of literature as a medium through which

material inequality and ecological imbalance can be maintained as well

as challenged.

The course has scheduled online classes.
