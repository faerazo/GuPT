## Summary

The aim of the course is to increase and deepen participants' knowledge of people's environmental choices and attitudes. In the course, the basic issue of why people in certain situations choose to act sustainable and in situations do not, is problematized and discussed.

## About

The course covers key theories and methods used in current psychological research aimed at clarifying how human behavior and attitudes can be influenced in a more environmentally friendly way. The final part of the course consists of independent, in-depth studies on a selected real environmental problem.

Teaching is given in the form of lectures and seminars. The course is based on active participation. The participants are expected to read specified articles each week that will be discussed during the seminar. Participants will also write their own individual work.
