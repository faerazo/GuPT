## About

Development economics is concerned with the economic transformation of developing economies. The focus is on the theories and methods used when analyzing economic issues in the development context. Examples of topics covered in development economics are the determinants of economic growth, such as the causes of poverty, population growth, and the impact of trade liberalization on developing countries. Knowledge of macro and micro theory at the advanced level is recommended.

NEK302 is given in the second quartile and can be

taken as an elective course in the Bachelor's programme together with

Basic Econometrics, NEK301 and Essay NEK316.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires 45 ECTS completed in Economics. Prior knowledge corresponding to 15 ECTS in Statistics is recommended.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.

## Facilities
