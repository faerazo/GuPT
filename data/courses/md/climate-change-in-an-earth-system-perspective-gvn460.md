Particular focus will then be placed on the climate system and its ongoing and expected changes, meteorological processes, weather and how the ecosystem is linked to the climate system.

## About

The course aims to provide basic knowledge of the Earth System focusing on the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere as well as their interactions.
