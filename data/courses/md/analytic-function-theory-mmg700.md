## About

This course treats derivatives and integrals of functions of one complex

variable. You will also get to know familiar functions such as the

sine, cosine and logarithm better, since they naturally live in the

complex plane. The kernel of the course is the Cauchy integral theorem

and its implications. We will also discuss conformal mappings, an

important technique which we do not treat in detail. We will also look

at some applications in physics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge equivalent to 60 credits in mathematics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
