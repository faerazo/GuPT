## About

_[Klicka här för att komma till den svenska informationen om kursen.](https://www.gu.se/studera/hitta-utbildning/introduktion-till-runor-och-runologi-sv1113)_

In this introduction to runes and runology, you familiar yourself with the rune-rows that have been in use in Sweden. You learn to read rune carvings, and learn about different interpretations of well known rune stones. Most of the preserved rune stones are from the second century of the Common Era until the end of the middle ages, but runes were used up to and until the 19th century. Through the rune carvings that persist to this day, and the cultural heritage that rune stones, runic staffs and other carved object make up, we can peek back in time and get a glimpse of what life was like a thousand years ago.

During the course, we will make an excursion around Västra Götaland to view rune carvings in the landscape.

The course will be held in English during spring semesters and Swedish during autumn semesters.
