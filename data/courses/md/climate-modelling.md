## Position

The course includes 15 credits at Master's level. The course is offered as an elective course subject to availability.

The course can be part of the following programmes:

1. Master's Programme in Earth Sciences (N2GVS)
2. Atmosphere, Climate and Ecosystems, Master's Programme (N2ACE)
3. Environmental Sciences (N2MVN)

## Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires basic knowledge of the climate system equivalent to GV1410 Geosciences, Basic Level Course 30 credits, GV0340 Earth System Sciences 7.5 credits, and GV2500 Data Analysis for Earth Sciences 7.5 credits and at least 180 credits in the main field of Earth Sciences, Environmental Science, Marine Sciences, Physics or Computer Science and Engineering. Students with equivalent educationmay, after review and approval, be admitted to the course.

## Content

The course deals with the ocean-ice-atmosphere dynamics of the climate system and their implementation in current generation climate models.

The students will learn about the physics of the climate system, their mathematical formulation, and how this formulation is either directly translated into a numerical scheme or a parameterization.

The students will also learn and practice computing methods that are necessary for climate modelling and climate model analysis. They will conduct their own multi-model analysis for model evaluation, climate change projections, or climate change event attribution studies.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

- summarise the physical and dynamical processs that control the climate system.
- describe basic numerical methods used to simulate the climate system.
- define current climate change scenarios and the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) process.

_Competence and skills_

- demonstrate basic knowledge of data analysis tools and Unix/Linux.
- compile and run a simple climate model.
- conduct CMIP-like-multi-model analyses to test a hypothesis.
- analyse and visualise data from climate models.

_Judgement and approach_

- critically appreciate the uncertainty in the climate model simulation.
- evaluate biases from multi-model runs and their consequences on climate change projections.

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-related, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg's confirmed sustainability criteria.


## Form of teaching

The course consists of lectures, computer-based exercises, and a compulsory individual project work. One oral presentation, a poster session, manuscript writing and student peer-review evaluate the student's understanding of the lectures and course literature, but also provide the student with the full experience of life as a climate modeller.

Language of instruction: English

## Examination formats

The course contains five assignments, each worth 3 credits or 20%. The student will obtain Pass (G) on an individual assignment if their grade on that assignment is 12% or more, and Pass with Distinction (VG) if it is 16% or more.

The five assignments are:

1. Climate modelling, first presentation, 3 credits (20%): U/G
2. Climate modelling, second presentation, 3 credits (20%): U/G
3. Climate modelling, peer-review, 3 credits (20%): U/G
4. Climate modelling, poster presentation, 3 credits (20%): U/G/VG
5. Climate modelling, manuscript, 3 credits (20%): U/G/VG

If a student who has been failed twice for the same examination element wishes to change examiner before the next examination session, such a request is to be granted unless there are specific reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 HF).

If a student has received a certificate of disability study support from the University of Gothenburg with a recommendation of adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment, an examiner may decide, if this is consistent with the course's intended learning outcomes and provided that no unreasonable resources would be needed, to grant the student adapted examination and/or adapted forms of assessment.

If a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be offered at least two examination sessions in addition to ordinary examination sessions. These sessions are to be spread over a period of at least one year but no more than two years after the course has been discontinued/changed. The same applies to placement and internship (VFU) except that this is restricted to only one further examination session.

If a student has been notified that they fulfil the requirements for being a student at Riksidrottsuniversitetet (RIU student), to combine elite sports activities with studies, the examiner is entitled to decide on adaptation of examinations if this is done in accordance with the Local Rules Regarding RIU students at the University of Gothenburg.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G), and Fail (U).

Grades are also provided as percentage, with each module worth 20%.

The overall grade on the course will be Pass with Distinction (VG) of the student obtains a total of 80% or more, and upon first submission Pass with Distinction (VG) on assignments 4 and 5 as well as Pass (G) on assignments 1, 2 and 3. The overall grade on the course will be Pass (G) if the student eventually obtains Pass (G) on all assignments.

## Course evaluation

The course evaluation is performed both as a scheduled dialouge between teacher and students, as well as written anonymus online survey.

The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
