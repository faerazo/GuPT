## Summary

The course is focused on value-related aspects of social sustainability that are understood to generate challenges and possibilities that require ethical analysis. There is a focus on pedagogical and philosophical investigation of social sustainability issues that are relevant to theories on teaching and learning. The language of instruction is English and the course is entirely online.

## About

Fundamental concepts such as “powerful knowledge” and “democratic subjectification” will be discussed, as well as issues concerning citizenship, power and social cohesion, social justice and (in) equality.

These concepts will inform a focus on various ethical and pedagogical strategies for democratic, inclusive teaching and learning, particurlarly with reference to virtue ethics in relation to the work of Nussbaum and Macintyre. Such strategies will be carefully examined and the participants in the course are offered opportunities to reflect upon and critically analyse their various forms and content.
