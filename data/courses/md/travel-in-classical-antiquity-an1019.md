## Summary

In this course we will discuss travel in the ancient Graeco-Roman world from c. 800 BC to c. 400 AD. Who travelled, why did they travel, where did they travel, and how did they travel? We will also discuss how contact with other parts of the Mediterranean influenced cultural development in the Greek and Roman world. We will examine a wide range of sources, both literary and archaeological.

## About

The desire to travel is part of the human condition. In the ancient Greek and Roman period people from all levels of society travelled widely, for many different reasons and not always voluntarily. Travel was also an important part of the mythology of the gods and other mythological figures. In this course we will discuss the archaeological and literary evidence for travel in Classical Antiquity (c. 800 BC-400 AD).
