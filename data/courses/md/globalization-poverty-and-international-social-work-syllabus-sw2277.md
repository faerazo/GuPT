## Objectives

After completing the course, the student is expected to be able to:

- identify and account for conflicts and tensions that arise in pace with increased globalization and climate change.
- describe and discuss how globalization and international conflicts affect migration patterns and human rights in specific regions.

_Skills and abilities_

- apply theoretical perspectives on migration and human rights to analyse how different countries (countries of origin and destination) deal with international migration and the social tensions that arise in connection with it.
- develop strategies to address global social problems, with particular attention to poverty and migration, and promote human rights.

_Judgement and approach_

- reflect on different ethical approaches in international social work with vulnerable groups.

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

The course is mainly conducted through lectures and seminars.

_Medium of instruction:_ English

## Examination formats

Examination of the course takes place through six seminars and a final examination.

The seminars require compulsory attendance and active participation, which may include written assignments. In the event of absence or insufficient participation, a replacement information must be submitted. In the event of absence or insufficient participation on more than two mandatory occasions, a replacement is not sufficient. In this case, the student must participate in the corresponding module at a future course occasion.

Seminar participation is graded with either Pass (G) or Fail (U). The final examination assignment is assessed with the grades Pass with distinction (VG), Pass (G) or Fail (U). If the assignment receives a grade of Fail (U) but is assessed to be close to the threshold for the grade Pass (G), supplementation must be allowed.

If a student who has failed twice on the same examination component wishes to change examiner before the next examination, such a request should be submitted in writing to the department and must be granted unless there are special reasons for doing so (Higher Education Ordinance Chapter 6, Section 22).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special study support, the examiner may, in the event that this is consistent with the objectives of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, decide to give the student an adapted examination or alternative form of examination.

In the event that a course has been discontinued or undergone major changes, the student must be guaranteed at least three examinations (including regular examinations) for a period of at least one year, but no more than two years after the course has ended/changed. The same applies to practical training and clinical placements, but with a limitation to only one additional examination occasion.

## Grades

The course gives one of the grades: Pass with distinction, Pass and Fail.

For the grade Pass, it is required that the intended learning outcomes are fulfilled and attendance and active participation in all compulsory parts of the course. For Pass with distinction, it is also required that the grade Pass with distinction is obtained on the final examination assignment.

## Course evaluation

Course evaluation takes place through an oral mid-course evaluation and a written evaluation at the end of the course. The evaluation results are communicated to the students and serve as a guide for further development of the course.
