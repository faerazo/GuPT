## About

The course aims to provide deeper knowledge and understanding of the complex relations between globalization and uneven development from a North-South perspective. The course content will approach questions such as: What is globalization and uneven development? How are these processes played out in the everyday lives of people? Can one generalize in relation to questions relating to the ‘North-South’, especially those pertaining to ‘development’? What roles do economy, democracy, rights and conflicts play in understanding these processes?

The course focuses on the processes (at various scales) that contribute to globalization and uneven development; with a particular emphasis on the consequences for access to and use of resources, inequality, poverty and redistribution. This focus includes gaining deeper knowledge and understanding of social, economic and political exclusion as uneven development occurs. Throughout, the course will also focus how the above processes articulate with issues of gender.
