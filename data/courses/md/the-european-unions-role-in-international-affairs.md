## Position

The course is a core course in European Studies in the first cycle and given as a single subject course. The course is also given as a single subject course for exchange students.

## Entry requirements

General entrance requirements.


## Content

The course aims to provide a broad understanding of the complex international role that the European Union (EU) plays in international affairs. The EU’s international presence has grown significantly over the last three decades. The EU is neither a traditional state nor simply an international intergovernmental organization. While the EU has significant decision-making authority and competence in certain policy areas, it lacks influence in others. The nature of the EU as a global actor is therefore subject of academic debate. The course will examine the EU’s role and authority in international affairs across different external policy fields. Students will gain knowledge of different theories and concepts that are used in academic analysis to examine the international role of the EU. Students will develop substantive empirical knowledge of how EU policies are made internally and compare the varied competence of the EU as an international actor across a number of external policies, including trade, development, enlargement, foreign and security policies.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

- Describe how the European Union’s role and external policies have developed in the international political system;
- Demonstrate knowledge of what role EU institutions and Member States play in the policy process of EU external action; and
- Account for how the EU’s competence and authority vary across external policy fields and issues.

_Competence and skills_

- Apply and compare key theories and concepts to explain the EU’s role and external policies in international affairs, orally and in writing
- Independently produce text in accordance with good academic practice, including proper citation technique and use of references
- Communicate clearly and proficiently in English both orally and in writing

_Judgement and approach_

- Critically reflect upon why the EU’s role and authority in international affairs vary across different issues and external policies.

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

Teaching is conducted through lectures, written assignments, and active participation in mandatory seminars.

_Language of instruction:_ English

## Examination formats

Students will be evaluated based on their performance in both written and oral assignments. The course consists of 7,5 credits and to get the credits the student must complete three forms of assignments:

1. Active seminar participation (3 credits)
2. Oral seminar presentation (1 credit)
3. Exam (3,5 credits)

Students can be asked to re-work graded assignments and re-submit them, albeit not exams. If the student does not re-submit the reworked assignment on time, the student will be failed on the assignment. A student who is not able to attend a compulsory part of the course can do an alternative assignment. The assignment will be described in the course guide.

Restrictions on the use of generative AI are stated in the course guide. Students are obliged to inform themselves about the current rules for examining elements such as assignments, seminar papers and other forms of exams in the course in question.

A student who has taken two exams in a course or part of a course without obtaining a pass grade is entitled to the nomination of another examiner. The student needs to contact the department for a new examiner, preferably in writing, and this should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).

In the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years, after the course has ceased/been changed.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U). To obtain the Pass grade, the student must receive a Pass on all the three forms of assessment. To obtain High Pass for the entire course, a student must receive a High Pass (VG) on the exam (3,5 credits) and Pass on the rest of the assessments.

To obtain the Pass grade the student must fulfill all the learning outcomes. To obtain High pass, the work of the student should show a very good ability to connect theoretical perspectives to empirical political outcomes, a high level of independent analytical skills and demonstrate in the written assignment high academic standards in terms of structure and language.

## Course evaluation

The student will be given the opportunity to do a course evaluation. The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.

## Other regulations

Students are recommended to have 60 credits in Social Sciences.
