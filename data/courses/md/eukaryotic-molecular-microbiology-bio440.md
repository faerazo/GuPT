## About

Eukaryotic Molecular Microbiology is a course about molecular biology studies of eukaryotic microorganisms, including yeast. You will study cellular regulatory mechanisms such as signal transduction, control of gene expression, stress responses and cell cycle control.

During the course, great importance is attached to experimental strategies and applications such as molecular biology and genetic analysis, cell biology and genome-wide techniques. Special focus is on complex molecular biological, cell biological, genetic and functional genomics processes in eukaryotic microorganisms. The course also addresses applications of yeast as a model organism for other eukaryotes (animals, plants, fungi or parasites) or in biotechnology, and introduces new application areas for yeast such as systems biology, surrogate genetics and synthetic biology.

After having completed the course, you should be able to conduct experimental laboratory work, including analysis and interpretation. You should also be able to independently understand and evaluate scientific literature and research information.

### Teaching

The theoretical part of the course consists of lectures, literature studies, oral presentations, seminars and group discussions. In the laboratory work, you will learn yeast molecular genetics and molecular biology techniques.

The course attaches great importance to individual and group studies of scientific literature aiming at analyzing experimental strategies and giving an overview of modern applications of molecular methods in eukaryotic microorganisms. You will get good practice in oral and written scientific presentation and argumentation. You will also get to independently plan a small research project and get training in critically reviewing other people’s research data.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Passed basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology and biodiversity and systematics, and completion of Chemistry, 30 hec or equivalent courses. English proficiency is required to the level of English 6/English Course B from Swedish Upper Secondary School, or be certified by an international recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS. In addition, completion of any of the advanced courses Microbiology, 15 hec, Molecular Biology, 15 hec, Biochemistry, 15 hec, or other equivalent courses.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the Bachelor’s programmes in Molecular Biology and in Biology, or in the Master’s programmes in Molecular Biology, in Biology or in Genomics and Systems Biology. The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

In this course, you will learn how to use and interpret problem solving methods that are generally applicable in a wide area of biology, biotechnology and biomedicine. You will be able to use your knowledge and skills in scientific research, education, development and innovation, or investigation and consulting.

Future employers can be universities, research institutes, clinical laboratories, innovation companies, the pharmaceutical or bioprocess industry, and the public administration. You can also work with plant breeding and environmental protection.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
