## About

Algebraic number theory is the part of number theory that uses methods from algebra to answer questions about integers in general and number fields in particular. The subject has inspired the Langlands Program, which won the Abel Prize, and is fundamental to parts of algebraic geometry. An important concept is algebraic integers, which concern the relationship between ordinary integers and rational numbers. But in most number fields, unique factorization of integers as a product of primes does not work.

In this course you will study algebraic integers and fractional ideals which work as “ideal numbers” in number fields. You will also learn how different factorization of ideals and integers can be.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of 90credits in mathematics and basic Galois theory equivalent to parts of the course MMA310 Galois Theory. In Galois theory, the requirements are: knowledge of separable field extensions, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the existence of the algebraic extension of the rational numbers, and the embedding of number fields therein.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
