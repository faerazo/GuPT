## Summary

Contemporary Art and Health is an innovative transdisciplinary course which introduces students to core concepts, theories, methods, and methodologies within the field of contemporary art and health. Organized through themes, the course takes an expanded social, cultural and political perspective on what both contemporary art and health can be understood to be and seeks to equip students with skills in critical thinking and analysis.

## About

### Contemporary Art and Health is a unique course aimed at artistic practitioners, cultural workers and healthcare practitioners who have an interest in understanding and working with the field of contemporary art and health. The course is designed to be of use both for students who have not undertaken work in this area and for those who are already doing so but would like the opportunity to learn more about this field of practice. By the end of the course students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of the development, delivery, and evaluation of practice in the field.

The course places pedagogical emphasis on sharing through dialogue and has the intention of generating a productive and care-driven environment for students and teachers to participate in and maintain as a learning community.  Contemporary Art and Health is led by Dr. Cathryn Klasto and includes contributions by invited guests. The course employs various teaching models including lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials and advance preparation is expected before teaching sessions. The course also requires that students have a reliable internet connection and good working ear/headphones to participate effectively.

**Course sessions** The course is taught in English and entirely at distance via Zoom. The course consists of lectures, seminars, workshops, and group tutorials. The course runs throughout the autumn semester 2024 and continues during spring semester 2025. Classes are structured in two-week blocks, where we meet for one evening per week. This is followed by a period of two-week independent study.
