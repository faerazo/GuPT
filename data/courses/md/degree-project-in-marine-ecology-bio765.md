## About

The course comprises one semester where the student performs and presents an independent scientific project within the topic of Biology aimed at Marine Ecology. The task could be:

• An experimental work or an analysis and evaluation of scientific data

• A critical literature review based on original articles.

The thesis project can be based on the Department of Marine Sciences, the Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences, at another department within the topic area, or externally at a company, institute or authority and is supervised by a scientifically schooled supervisor.

The finished project is presented in written form as a scientific report and through an oral presentation.

Upon agreement, the project can be prolonged to 45 or 60 points.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 285 credits

## After graduation

## Facilities
