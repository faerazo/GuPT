## About

The skin is our largest organ. Knowledge and understanding about chemical and immunological interactions between the skin and our environment are central in the context of a sustainable society. Every day, we are exposed to a multitude of chemical compounds. Sometimes, the exposure is deliberate, as for topical or transdermal drug delivery, but equally frequent the exposure is unintended.

The course Dermatochemistry provides in-depth knowledge about the central aspects of pharmacy and biotoxicology in the context of skin uptake. The course is interdisciplinary and deals with

- the structure, function and immunology of the skin
- mechanistic understanding of chemical structure-activity relations and photochemistry
- methods for studies of skin uptake, risk analysis and prevention.

A central component of the course is a project work on a research topic of your choice.

Dermatochemistry is a course intended for students during the last year of the Pharmacy programme. It can also be applied for as an elective stand-alone course for other programmes.

### Teaching

The course consists of lectures, seminars and a project work, both in group and individually. The examination includes a written exam, as well as written and oral presentations. The project work includes literature survey, report writing and peer-review.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

90 credits within Pharmacy/Medicine or 75 credicts in chemistry including KEM031, Organic chemistry (15 credits). Students with equal qualifications can be admitted.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you are a student at the Pharmacy programme, you will normally proceed with your master’s project after this course. If you take this course as an elective stand-alone course, you can potentially fit it in in your programme curriculum. If you are already working, this course can be seen as competence development.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
