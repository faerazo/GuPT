## About

The course aims to give you knowledge of various scientific methods of analysis for applications in conservation of cultural heritage objects and environments. The course also provides tools for critically evaluating how these methods are applied and how they inform our decisions in heritage conservation. During the course, you are given the opportunity to apply the methods through a theoretical individual project and are introduced to research planning.
