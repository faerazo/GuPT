## About

This course presents applications of stochastic calculus and partial

differential equations in mathematical finance. Besides the basic

options on stocks and currency, the course deals also with interest rate

models, stochastic volatility models and financial derivatives whose

value depends on the history of the underlying stock. This course is

also fundamental for portfolio theory, which is however not treated in

the course.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The equivalent of the course MMG810 Options and Mathematics or in all 90 credits in Mathematics and Mathematical statistics.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms.
