## Summary

During the summer of 2024 the freestanding summer course Individual Project Work 1 will explore socially engaged arts practice by listening to our confusion and understanding its relationship to contemporary society.

The course will support students to develop projects (either as individuals or in partnership with other students enrolled on the course). The course is based on online presentations, seminars, and supervision in combination with on-site / hybrid intensive workshops.

## About

In the course Individual Project Work 1— Listen to your confusion, we will investigate the personal and the collective by addressing how our mental states of noise and confusion correlate to a structural noise arising from a disintegrating society.

This course will focus on practices and theories of sound, listening, noise, voice and critical theory. It is open to students with a broad range of artistic expression who are interested in exploring their practice in relation to different forms of “registering” and listening. No previous experience with sound-production is necessary. The course will support students in developing their individual projects, while it will encourage collaboration as a form of listening.

The course is based on online presentations, seminars, and supervision in combination with on-site/hybrid intensive workshops. This year the teaching team comprises of Mattin, Ewa Einhorn, Ray Brassier and Jessika Khazrik. More information about the teaching team in Canvas

The course is rooted in live research currently underway in our academy and within our wider networks of affiliation.

**Online and IRL**

The course has "meet up" IRL aspects in: (i) Berlin, Germany (June 5-12).

The course is divided into three phases. The first phase involves an intensive introduction to the course theme, along with all on-site/hybrid gatherings and tutorials, which occur in June and July. This phase aims to prepare students for collaborative and individual project development during July. The students' projects are then presented, elaborated on, and assessed in August.
