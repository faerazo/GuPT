## Summary

If you have a background in basic-level psychology and wish to learn more about how people think, feel, and behave in social settings, this course is for you. You will study classical social psychological works as well as the cutting-edge research literature, guided by teachers with ample research experience. The course will develop your ability to think critically about research, which makes it particularly suitable if you are considering moving on to doctoral-level studies.

## About

Social psychology is the scientific study of how people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors operate in a social context. Since the early 20th century, social psychologists have examined some of the most fundamental questions about humans as social beings: What is the nature of stereotypes and prejudice? What principles determine people’s behavior in groups? Why are we attracted to some people and repelled by others? How do our attitudes form and how can we influence those of others? Moreover, social psychology contributes to the understanding of, and may offer solutions to, several problems in modern society, including racial discrimination, sexism, overconsumption, and intergroup aggression.

This course invites you on a journey from classical social psychological studies to modern-day cutting-edge research. Working directly with advanced research literature, you will enhance your understanding of the social nature of human beings and at the same time learn about the craft of doing social psychological science. All teachers on the course are themselves active researchers in their respective areas. If you are interested in pursuing doctoral-level studies, the course offers a unique opportunity to hone your skills in thinking and writing about research.

Teaching takes place in the form of lectures and seminars. During the second half of the course, you will independently write a literature review on a social psychological research topic of your own choosing.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To enter the course, at least 90 HEC in psychology at Bachelor?s level (first cycle), including a thesis of 15 credits, is required.Applicants must also prove knowledge of English: English 6/English Course B or the equivalent level as certified by an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL or IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Since the course gives you practice in reading, analyzing, and evaluating research literature, it is a good preparation for professions where these skills are necessary (e.g., producing reviews and reports for public organizations). As the course focuses on developing your skills in thinking scientifically about research designs and methods, it is also an excellent preparation for subsequent studies at the doctoral level.
