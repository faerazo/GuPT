## About

The course treats Zermelo-Fraenkel's set theory, ZF, formulated in first-order logic, and takes its starting point in the set theoretical construction of the natural numbers and how set theory can constitute a foundation for mathematics. Furthermore, properties of infinite sets are treated, with a focus on cardinality and properties of well-orderings. The cumulative hierarchy is discussed as well as the role of the axiom of choice in the axiomatisation of the concept of set.

The is a web-based course. Recorded lectures are made available during the course and followed up by quizzes in the form of digital tests.
