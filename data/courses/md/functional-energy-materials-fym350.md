## About

Materials science is crucial for the development of new technologies. In this course thestudent will learn how materials development has laid the ground for modern energytechnology and how it in the future can be a cornerstone in a sustainable energysystem. Further, the course will give an overview of the opportunities and limitations ofwhich specific material properties, and based on them functions, might contribute withto the future energy systems. Conceptually, the course is based on the relation between fundamental materialsproperties and the performance of a device. The course content covers a generalintroduction to the materials challenges related to the design and development of next-generation energy technologies, and an in-depth analysis of materials in batteries, solarcells, fuel cells, hydrogen storage, thermoelectric materials.
