## Summary

Knowledge of how glacial landforms and sediments are formed can be used to understand how glaciers are affected by different climatic, geographic and temporal factors. This course provides the opportunity to deepen your knowledge in the field and to put theory into practice.

The course introduces basic glacial landforms processes, field mapping and also includes field components.

## About

The course covers glacial landforms and sediments and glacial and paraglacial processes. The course also highlights processes in alpine glaciers and ice sheets and the connection to glacial landforms and sediments.

Field studies, cartography and field methods are used to investigate glacial landforms and sediments. The course also covers related areas such as Quaternary history, regional and global glacial history and paleoclimate.

A major part of the course consists of and independent project work where landforms and sediments are investigated in the field or by remote sensing.

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.
