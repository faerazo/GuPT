## About

The course gives an introduction to, and practice in, creation of different types of prototypes in Interaction Design. The contents cover both physical prototypes (e.g. paper prototypes, prototyping through controllers and micro-controllers, and prototyping through tinkering and physical modelling) and digital, screen-based prototypes (sketching and video prototypes). The course also gives an understanding of what to test with different prototypes, and when.

## Prerequisites and selection
