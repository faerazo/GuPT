## About

The course gives a mainly semantically oriented introduction to modern modal propositional logic and Kripke semantics. It offers both a solid mathematical basis and an introduction to some of the many applications within, e.g., philosophy, metamathematics and computer science. The course is mainly theoretically oriented, but also contains practical exercises.

The course is given by the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science. [Link to the webpage](https://www.gu.se/en/flov).
