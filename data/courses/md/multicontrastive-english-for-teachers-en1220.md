## Summary

The aim of this course is to cater for the need for contrastive components for teachers of English with a foreign teacher's degree or students from independent courses who wants a qualification for the Swedish school system. The course consists of two modules: contrastive grammar/proficiency and contrastive phonetics/pronunciation.

## About

Using students' own linguistic proficiency in both English and Swedish as well as other mother tongues to understand and discover areas where language learners are likely to run into problems we analyze authentic text material in order to discuss possible contrastive differences teachers need to be aware of to help learners improve and develop their language skills.

The course has scheduled online classes.
