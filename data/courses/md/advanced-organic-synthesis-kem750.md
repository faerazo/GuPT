## About

Complex molecules, such as drugs, polymers, detergents and natural products, are an innate part of everyone’s daily life. The assembly of complex molecules from simple and readily available compounds plays an integral and indispensable role in the development of biological active compounds, such as drugs and functional materials. Synthetic organic chemistry is therefore a key area of science for the future development of society.

The course in Advanced Organic Synthesis highlights the challenges of the assembly processes, in other words the syntheses. The course provides you with the necessary tools to efficiently plan successful synthetic routs to obtain new compounds with improved or new desirable properties.

The course also gives you a thorough knowledge and understanding of

- retrosynthetic analysis
- analysis of selectivity, stereochemical, environmental and safety problems
- functional group inter-conversion and protective group methodology
- modern methods for carbon-carbon, and carbon-heteroatom bond formations.

After the course, you should be able to understand and suggest solutions to problems within advanced organic synthesis.

The course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

90 credits in chemistry, including KEM815, Advanced Organic Chemistry (15 credits), or equal qualifications. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Master's programme in Chemistry (N2KEM)
- Master's programme in Organic and Medicinal Chemistry (N2KEL).

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
