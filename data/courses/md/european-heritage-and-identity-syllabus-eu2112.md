## Content

This course addresses and historicizes current processes of integration and disintegration in Europe, and the notion of the ‘European’ today. Issues of heritage and identity are closely linked to political, cultural, and economic issues. Students will learn to analyse current European processes with political as well as social perspectives, and gain a thorough understanding of Europe’s historical past. The course relates various notions of what it means to be ‘European’, including Eurocentric criticism, to other competing, complementary, and conflicting territorial identities, by analysing the creation of history, heritage, and memory within European institutions.

Teachers from different academic disciplines contribute with different approaches to European integration, heritage, and identity. The multidisciplinary character of the course provides students with insights into the theoretical and practical experiences of different fields within European studies.

## Objectives

- demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how institutions, and political and cultural processes, influence European identity building and European cultural heritage
- relate the idea of a European identity to current and historical contexts as well as to cultural experiences of memory and identity

**Competence and skills**

## Sustainability labelling

No sustainability labelling.


## Form of teaching

The course is taught in lectures, compulsory seminars, and compulsory assignments.

_Language of instruction:_ English

## Examination formats

Students will be evaluated based on their performance in written and oral assignments, and active participation at obligatory seminars. The course consists of a group project with a report submission and oral seminar presentation (3 credits), as well as two individual papers with accompanying seminars (3,5 credits each).

Completion of examined assignments are permitted. If the student does not submit the completion on time, the student will be failed on the assignment.

A student who is not able to attend a compulsory part of the course can do an alternative assignment. The assignment will be described in the course guide.

If a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).

In cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given. This may not be in conflict with Chapter 6 Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U). To obtain the Pass grade (G) of the course, all mandatory assignments need a pass grade. To obtain the Pass with Distinction (VG), one of the two individual papers needs to receive the grade Pass with Distinction (VG), while passing the other assignments.

To obtain the Pass grade the student must therefore fulfil all the learning outcomes by actively participating in compulsory seminars as well as obtaining Pass on the written assignments. To obtain Pass with Distinction the work of the student should, besides satisfying the requirements for the Pass grade, show a very good ability to connect theoretical perspectives to practical examples and a good, independent analytical ability. In addition, to obtain Pass with distinction the student’s written assignment must fulfil high academic standards in terms of structure and language.

## Course evaluation

The student will be given the opportunity to do a course evaluation. The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.
