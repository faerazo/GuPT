## Summary

The link between language and politics is a key area for linguistic analysis, especially in the German language tradition. This course provides you with an introduction to political linguistics as a research field and how language and politics can be studied in concrete terms.

## About

You will learn about important analysis tools such as slogans, keywords, deontic meaning, text and discourse, and their theoretical attributes and application in linguistic analysis. We dip into past and present political events in Germany and how these events can be analysed linguistically.

This course provides you with tools for analysing how politics and political values are communicated and constructed in the public sphere through linguistic acts. The close relationship of political linguistics with rhetoric, discourse, conceptual analysis, linguistic criticism, semantics and pragmatics is addressed.

The course is taught in English and/or German.
