## Summary

This course will provide a focused introduction to the archaeology of copper and copper alloy metalwork. We will discuss traditional and modern natural scientific analysis methods for metalwork that give information about the exchange networks, chronology, production, use, and disposal. Furthermore, two lectures will introduce the main periods of copper use in European Prehistory, i.e. the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age. The teaching language will be English.

## About

This is a stand-alone course that students can elect to further their basic knowledge of archaeological metalwork. We will go through various different aspects of metalwork analysis. We will train hands-on to sort copper alloy metalwork using typology, which helps to understand the chronology and function of the objects. This is a method transferable to other material culture. During the course, a range of natural scientific methods will be discussed that are used to learn about the entire biography of the objects from the origin of raw materials (lead isotope analysis), their production (trace elemental analysis, metallography, traceology), and use (traceology) to their eventual discarding including what happened to them chemically after their deposition (corrosion studies).

Students will learn to analyse the data source-critically and choose which methods to use to investigate the material further. To this end, they will be able to discuss which information each method provides and judge the suitability of the objects for such analysis.

The course consists of various lectures in which different copper alloys, metal objects from several periods, and analysis methods are introduced. In addition, there will be seminars in which the students can test and experience some methods themselves and discuss their results.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To gain permission to the course, at least 30 credits in undergraduate archaeology courses or equivalent are required.
