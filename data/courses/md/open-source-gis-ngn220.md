## Summary

This course deepens your knowledge of Geographic Information Systems, GIS, with a focus on open source (OS).

This course provides the opportunity to deepen your knowledge in the field and to put theory into practice through theoretical background and practical GIS exercises. Basic programming is included.

## About

The aim of the course is

- to provide advanced, broadening knowledge of all that open source (OS) includes and how it is used in geographic information technology (GIT).
- to realize the potential possibilities when using OS programs.

The course explores the theoretical background to some extent, but above all consists of practical components with programs built on open source. Basic programming is included.

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Geography, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- lectures
- supervised project work
- written assignment (exercises)

Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires a successfully completed course in GIS of at least 15 credits. Applicants with an equivalent education can, after review and approval, be admitted to the course.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Geographers often work with urban planning, environmental management or broader issues related to sustainable development, in Sweden or internationally. As a geographer, you may work on planning new public transport, roads, water supply or urban planning for climate change. Geographers can be found in business, government and international organizations.

Our former students work, for example, as environmental consultants, coordinators, urban planners and GIS consultants. You also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.
