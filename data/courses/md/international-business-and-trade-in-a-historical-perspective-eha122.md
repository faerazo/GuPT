## About

The objective of this course is to discuss the development of world

trade from early modern times until today. Firstly, the historical

development of world trade and trade policies are discussed in terms of

causes and effects of international trade. A central aspect is the

discussion of the importance of trade for growth and distribution of

wealth over the world. The role of trade for countries in the less

industrialised world is compared to its role for the industrialised

world. Linked to this, is the discussion of whether protectionism or

free trade has been the best way to promote economic development.

Secondly, the course relates to the development of “big business”.

The aim is to achieve an understanding for the present situation of

multinational companies by studying their historical development. The

studies start with how multi-national companies were formed.

Multinationals have sometimes been accused of contributing to social

injustice in countries in the third world. In the industrialised world

they are accused of disrupting competition. The effects of big business

establishment are to a large extent decided by how the activities are

regulated. The national state can build institutions and regulate

business activities by for example introducing tariffs, different forms

of taxation, regulation of wages and so on. An important issue is to

study under what circumstances multinational companies are contributing

to growth and redistribution and when they are not.
