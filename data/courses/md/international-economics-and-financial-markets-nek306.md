## About

The focus is on important aspects of international economics such as the balance of payments, the structure and operation of the foreign exchange and futures markets, the exchange rate system, international financial crises, simple models of exchange rate determination, and more advanced open-macroeconomic modelling.

The advanced courses can be applied for in 30-credit course packages

(NEK20) or each course separately if you are only taking a single

course.

International Economics and Financial Markets, 7.5 credits (NEK306) (taught in English).

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The job market for economists is excellent. Within many qualified jobs in the private and public sectors, a good ability to analyze complex socio-economic issues is required. Through studies in economics, you get tools to collect, analyze and interpret data. Our students are in demand on the labor market and work for, among others, **major Swedish banks, Volvo, Swedbank, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance,** and **the University of Gothenburg.**

Another possibility is to go for a research career. The Department of Economics at the University of Gothenburg conducts research in a wide range of areas, such as environmental economics, financial economics, development economics and behavioral economics.

## Facilities

Most of the Business School's operations are located at Vasagatan 1, but we also have premises at Viktoriagatan 13. The premises at Vasagatan 1 house the financial library, which is several floors high and has many study places.
