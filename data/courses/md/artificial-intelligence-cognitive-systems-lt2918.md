## Summary

The course gives a survey of theory and practical implementations on how to build artificial systems that approximate intelligent human behavior by connecting natural language with the physical world through action and perception

## About

Some topics that we will discuss are:

•    semantic approaches to natural language, (inter)action and perception,

•    their computational modelling with data-driven (machine/deep learning) and top-down (expert) based methods,

•    grounded language models,

•    situated dialogue systems,

•    robotic systems and sensors,

•    creation of resources and datasets,

•    ethical considerations when building and using such systems,

•    generation and interpretation of scene descriptions and route instructions,

•    computational modelling of spatial cognition,

•    computational modelling of situated interaction, and others.
