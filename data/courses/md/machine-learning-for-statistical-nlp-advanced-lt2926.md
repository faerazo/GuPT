learning for language technology applications, including multimodal

applications. This course will cover neural networks and related

contemporary techniques and concepts.  Students will improve their

machine learning skills by developing simple NLP applications in

widely-used programming frameworks and get practice in making and

implementing design choices independently.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires a passed result in each of the following:

programming, 7.5 hec, and

machine learning, 7.5 hec, and
