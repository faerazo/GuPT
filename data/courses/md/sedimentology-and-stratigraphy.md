## Course modules

Theory, 4 Credits


Exercises/field exercises, 2.5 Credits


Excursion, 1 Credits


## Position

The course includes 7,5 credits at the undergraduate leve and i part of a Bachelor's degree in Earth Sciences. The course is offered as an elective course subject to availability.

## Entry requirements

For admission to the course, at least 60 creditsin the main field of Earth Sciences or Marine Science is required. Students with equivalent education can, after review and approval, be given access to the course.

## Content

The course includes three modules:

**1\. Theory, 4 credits**

Grading scale: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U)

Objectives 1-5 under Knowledge and understanding are examined through written exam and quiz. For the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) on the module, Pass with Distinction (VG) on all objectives is required.

**2\. Exercise/field exercises, 2,5 credits**

Grading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)

Objectives 1-4 under Competence and skills are examined through written reports.

**3\. Excursion, 1 credits**

Grading scale: Pass (G) and Fail (U)

The aim of excursion(s) within Scandinavia is to investigate coastal outcrops of Mesozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, as well as observations of modern sedimentological processes along coasts and rivers.

For the grade Pass (G), participation in excursion(s) is required. The module is compulsory, but can be replaced by a project work after agreement with the course manager if the student cannot participate.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

- define, explain and distinguish basic sedimentological properties that influence or have been influenced by sedimentary processes: fluid properties, flow veolcity, particle size, orientation of grain, geochemistry of depositional environments, etc.
- define, explain and distinguish basic processes in sedimentology: e.g., erosion, weathering, transport and sedimentation.
- acquire a basic knowledge of stratigraphy and stratigraphic nomenclature such as lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy, and sequencestratigraphy.
- identify, explain and illustrate different depositional environments (delta, flood plain, alluvial fan, reef, etc.) as well as typical characteristics for these.

_Competence and skills_

- pland and carry out field work, logging as well as measurement of paleo flows in sedimentary sequences and, in the lab, sediemnt analyses (for example dry and wet sieving, grain size analysis as well as pipette dispersion).

_Judgement and approach_

- to apply with a scientific approach sedimentological, stratigraphic and geochronological knowledge on different geoscientific issue as well as to give an increased understanding of sediemntology and stratigraphy, as well as the most important dating methods and to be a disciplinary foundation for continued studies in geology.

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-related, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg's confirmed sustainability criteria.


## Form of teaching

The teaching consists of lectures, seminars, exercises and field exercises.

Language of instruction: English

## Examination formats

Module 1: Theory, 4 credits: Fail/Pass/Pass with Distinction

Module 2: Exercises/field exercises, 2,5 credits: Fail/Pass

Module 3: Excursion, 1 credits: Fail/Pass

If a student who has twice received a failing grade for the same examination component wishes to change examiner ahead of the next examination session, such a request should be made to the department in writing and should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for study support for students with disabilities, the examiner may, where it is compatible f√∂r the objectives of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

In the event that a course had ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to internships and professional placements (VFU), although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).

For the grade Pass (G) on the entire course, a passing grade is required for all graded sections. For the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) on the entire course, the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) on the written exam is also required.

## Course evaluation

The students are given the opportunity to make an anonymous, written evaluation of the course.

The result of and possible chnages to the course will be shared with the students who participated in the evaluation and the students who are starting the course.

## Other regulations

Students admitted to the N1GVS Bachelor's Programme in Earth Sciences are given priority for admission to the course.
