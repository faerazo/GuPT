## About

In this course you will study functions of several complex variables that are complex differentiable in a suitable sense. Similar to the situation of one complex variable, complex differentiability is a much stronger notion than real differentiability. This makes it possible to develop tools and obtain results that would not extend to the real setting.

Complex analysis in several variables is a field that has seen great development during the last century and there are connections to several parts of modern mathematics, like analysis, algebra, geometry, and topology. In the course you will study various central concepts and methods within the field.

Although much of the basic theory of several complex variables can easily be derived from the one-dimensional setting, there are phenomena, like the famous Hartogs’s phenomenon about extensions of complex differentiable functions, that occur only in higher dimensions. During the course you will learn about this and other examples that illustrate that the theory of complex variables in many ways essentially differs from the theory of one complex variable.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

General entry requirements and the equivalent of 90 credits in mathematics, including the equivalent of the course MMG700 Analytic Function Theory.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
