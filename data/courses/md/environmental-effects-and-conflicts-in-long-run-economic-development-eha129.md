## About

The aim of this course is to critically examine key concepts of

environmental economic theory, through the use of historical analysis.

For this purpose both case-studies on micro level and comparative

measures of global change are used. The development of small scale

manual production for local consumption to large scale energy-intensive

production for inter-regional and global markets put significant stress

on energy, infrastructure and institutional regimes. This motivates that

the use and conflicts around natural resources are given special

attention in long-run historical analysis of environmental history.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Studies in Economic History give you the possibility to work in a variety of professions, both in the public and private sectors. For example analysts, information officers, and economists.

## Facilities

The School of Business, Economics and Law (usually nicknamed "Handels") is located at Vasagatan 1 and at Viktoriagatan 13. The building at Vasagatan houses the Economics Library, which is several floors high and offers many study places.
