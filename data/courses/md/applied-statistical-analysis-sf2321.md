## Summary

The course is aimed at those who want a comprehensive understanding of how statistical analysis methods can be applied, especially various regression techniques, both in the social sciences and in public and commercial analyses and reports.

## About

This course teaches theory-based empirical analysis through statistical methods through the use of statistical data programs, Stata. Lectures and exercises are intertwined with each other as you learn about, among other things, principles of statistical inference and a number of statistical methods for example factor analysis and different forms of regression.

The course consists of two parts. In the first part, the teaching is arranged in workshops. Each workshop is concentrated around a regression technique and consists of lectures, teacher led computer lab sessions and one hand-in assignment. You will learn the most common regression techniques such as linear regression, categorical regression, multi-level regression and time series regression.

The second part of the course is focused on an independent research paper in which skills are put into practices and statistical methods are applied on a self-chosen research problem and data material.

The course is an elective quantitative research methods course in the Master's Programme in Political Science, the Programme for Master in Sociology, the Master's Programme in Criminology, the Master's Programme in European Studies, Master's Programme in International Administration and Global Governance and the Master's Programme in Political Communication.
