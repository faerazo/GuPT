## Summary

What makes some species vulnerable to extinction while others rapidly invade new regions? How sensitive are different ecosystems to disturbance? In this course you will learn about processes acting at individual, population and ecosystem levels. You will learn to build simple computer models to assess the extinction risk of a species under different scenarios. Population genetics and other molecular methods are pivotal tools in modern ecology – in this class you will gain basic skills within these fields.

## About

Initially, population ecology is treated with one or more species. We use models to describe population development, considering the environment, risk of extinction, and other factors. We also touch upon spatial structure and investigate how hunting and fishing affect a population.

During two weeks we study the function of two marine ecosystems, shallow eelgrass meadows and the pelagic ecosystem. We focus on processes and the importance of environmental factors, including human impact.

The theoretical part continues with population genetics, describing genetic variation, natural selection and gene flow, and the impact they have on populations. Conservation genetics is an important part and we provide information on molecular methods in ecology.

The course ends with a number of mini-projects where methods from the course are applied during a week's group work.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

1\. Basic courses in biology encompassing 60 credits and including the areas cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology, and biodiversity and systematics, or the equivalent. At least 30 credits must be passed.

2\. Approved courses within the first and second year of the bachelor program in marine sciences, or the equivalent. At least 90 of the 120 credits must be passed.

3\. Approved courses within the first year of the bachelor program in environmental sciences and one additional 15 credits basic biology course, or the equivalent. At least 60 of the 75 credits must be passed

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B), and for two weeks at Kristineberg Marine Research Station.

Kristineberg is one of the two stations for marine research at the university. It is a fantastic place to study the marine life in the Skagerrak, the most productive waters in Sweden. You will stay in 2-4 person rooms and enjoy the full board in the station restaurant for a very attractive price. Housing is paid by the university. You can stay at the station over the weekend between the two field weeks if you like.
