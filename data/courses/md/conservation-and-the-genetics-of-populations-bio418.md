## Summary

Loss of biological diversity is often caused by human activities that affect ecology of species, such as habitat change, exploitation and spread of alien species.

The course is aimed at those who want to learn how to use population genetic methods to preserve biodiversity at population, species and ecosystem level

## About

This course

provides a background on how population genetic methods can be used in

conservation of biological diversity on different levels, i.e. population,

species and ecosystems. The usefulness of genetic tools and concepts in

conservation, as well as ecology, evolution and other fields of biology, is

continually expanding as new molecular technologies are developed at a high

rate. This course deals with how these methods can be applied in research and

management of natural resources.

The course deals

with the following parts:

- Importance of


biodiversity at population, species and ecosystem level
- Threats to,


and protection of, biodiversity
- Genetics and


conservation biology
- Population genetic concepts and methods
- Modern DNA technology and bioinformatics
- Current issues


in conservation biology such as: management and restoration of treasured and


cultivated species, identification and monitoring, red listing, inbreeding and


demographics, invasive species, climate change.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Alternative 1: Completed basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology, biodiversity and systematics, or equivalent.

Alternative 2: 90 credits approved of 120 credits on courses within the first two years of the Bachelor program in marine sciences, University of Gothenburg, or equivalent.

Alternative 3: Completed courses in the first year of the Bachelors in science in Environmental science program and an additional 15 hp basic level course in biology, or equivalent.

In addition to any of the three alternatives above, at least one approved in-depth course (15 credits) in a relevant area in biology at the Bachelor level and English 6/English B or equivalent, is required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B).

## Recommended study route

The course consists of lectures, literature seminars, computer exercises and project work, where literature seminars, computer exercises and project work are compulsory elements. Project work is an essential part of the course.
