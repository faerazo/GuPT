## Summary

The course highlights the role of exile literature within a democratic public sphere. The aim of the course is to enable you to develop your fiction writing by critically reflecting on issues of movement between countries, languages, literary publics and contexts.

## About

This course focuses on the role that exile literature plays within a larger democratic community and the discussion of how exile is shaping contemporary literature. The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity to develop their literary writing and to reflect together with others on questions concerning transitions between nations, countries, languages and literary contexts and communities.Students will explore the theme of exile in relation to their own writing as well as the writing of others. The course discusses strategies and methods you can use to develop your writing in situations where the context of the literary work is changing. The course deals with literary writing, reading and translation in relation to experiences of displacement and loss – as well as reorientation and innovation.

The main part of the course will be taking place online on Fridays, with lectures, seminars and workshops. The examination seminars in the end of the course will be scheduled to Gothenburg, but with the possibility to participate digitally.
