## About

This course offers a broad theoretical overview of linguistics and aims to give the students an understanding of the structure and different contexts of language. There is a focus on sociolinguistics, language history, language change and first and second language acquisition, as well as on the structure of the English language. The course also addresses basic linguistic characteristics of academic spoken and written English. The written parts in particular give an introduction to English scientific and scholarly prose. Items include linguistic awareness, linguistic accuracy, stylistics, academic vocabulary, cohesion and underlying cultural aspects.
