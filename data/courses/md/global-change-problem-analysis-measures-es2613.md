## Summary

Scientific environmental knowledge is the foundation for promoting ecological, social, and economic sustainability and is at the core of today’s crucial global change issues. Society is in critical need of environmental scientists that are well-founded in natural science, but at the same time have a good understanding of the societal context for working with environmental issues. It is the goal of this course to provide both and to prepare you for working towards a sustainable future as an environmental expert.

## About

- Analysing environmental problems from many different perspectives, such as temporal trends, severity, geographical extent, and economic aspects.
- Studying many different types of mitigation possibilities, such as new technology solutions, company strategies, design and implementation of international agreements and policy making.

The course attracts students from many different parts of the world, providing opportunities for valuable exchange of ideas and perspectives and enriching your network in the environmental field.
