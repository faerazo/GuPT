## Summary

The course aims to provide students with knowledge of quantitative models to describe the relationships between climate and weather-sensitive aspects of society and the environment.

## About

Climate data applications are conceptually-based, semi-empirical models that link weather conditions to specific events affecting society or the environment. These models are the basis for transforming climate knowledge into a useful application, for operational planning or risk calculations.

The course aims to provide an understanding and knowledge of how such  models are created, using real-life examples covering for example surface hydrology, urban air quality or agricultural systems.

In the course you will learn:

- about semi-empirical models.
- about time-step models (simulations)
- empirical statistical models, parametric models.
- about alternatives for interpreting and presenting results, simple visualizations, trend lines, multi-criteria analysis, hypothesis testing.
- about climate model projections, scenarios, bias correction, percentile-based thresholds.
- to implement simple climate data applications in a programming environment.

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

### Teaching

The teaching consists of:

- lectures.
- compulsory class-exercises (mainly computer-based) with short reports.
- a major group project with written report and student presentation.

Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to the course, ability to performdata analysis corresponding to GV2500 Data Analysis for Earth Sciences, 7,5 credits, or GVN330 Cimate Data Analyses, 7,5 credits,is required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you study Earth Science, you have good career opportunities both in Sweden and abroad. You can choose to work in industry, as a consultant, project manager or in public administration.

Our former students work, for example, with natural resource management, environmental issues and urban planning, you also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.

## Exchange opportunities

If you are studying Earth Science at the University of Gothenburg, there are good opportunities for exchange studies during your studies. This is often seen as a good asset when applying for jobs, as many jobs require international collaboration.

We have over 100 agreements within Erasmus and other exchange programs with universities around the world, both within and outside Europe.
