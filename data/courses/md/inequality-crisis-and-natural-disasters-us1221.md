## Summary

This course addresses questions about how we can understand equality and how inequality relates to and manifests itself in crises and disasters, especially those triggered by climate-related factors.

## About

This course provides an overview of different perspectives on

inequality: how we understand and define inequality, how inequality is

reproduced and what actions can be taken to address inequality. More

specifically, the course explores how societal inequality manifests

itself by studying crises and disasters as such emergencies expose

inequality of various kinds.

Together, we work on questions of what can be done to prevent crises

and disasters. We pay particular attention to crises triggered by

climate-related natural disasters such as floods, droughts and storms. These are often presented as purely natural phenomena when in fact their

causes are strongly related to human and social factors.

In relation to these disasters, issues of

vulnerability and resilience take centre stage, which in turn are

related to issues of inequality; anyone can be affected by a disaster,

but some people live in more vulnerable conditions (and are more

severely affected) than others. In other words, disasters, which are

increasingly important to understand and address because they are the

result of unsustainable forms of development, climate change and lack of

adaptation, are events that can teach us something about social

inequality, its intersectional composition and how we can work on

prevention. Students practice applied research by writing an evaluation

of a disaster.

### Teaching

Teaching consists mainly of lectures, seminars, individual writing exercises and group work.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

The course provides knowledge on how crises and disasters are linked to

inequality and is a good component of a programme where you intend to

work on local as well as global environment, development and climate

challenges.
