## Content

The course addresses the problems of integrating different national market systems into one single market. The interplay between formal legal restrictions, economical functions of the single market and the political policy-making process, as well as their consequences, will be central themes throughout this course. The aim is to provide a thorough understanding of the complex process of the creation of a single internal market within the European Union. The internal market’s consequences for the spatial pattern of manufacturing and services, trade, labour, capital flows and infrastructural development in Europe and its neighbouring countries will be analysed, as well as broader societal consequences. The relation between regional, national and supranational policies and decisions is extensively investigated in the course, with special focus on a number of relevant areas of common policy, as well as policy areas subject to common legislation within the ‘acquis communautaire’, framework. The course is based on thematic lectures, seminars and student’s presentations.

## Examination formats

The assessment takes the form of three case-study assignments (written reports and oral presentations), 1.5 credits each, and a written exam (5,5 credits).

Students can be asked to re-work graded assignments and re-submit them. If the student does not re-submit the reworked assignment on time, the student will be failed on the assignment.

A student who is not able to attend a compulsory part of the course can do an alternative assignment. The assignment will be described in the course guide.

If a student, who has failed the same examined component twice, wishes to change examiner before the next examination, a written application shall be sent to the department responsible for the course and shall be granted unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6, Section 22 of Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for special educational support, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, the examiner may decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

At least five occasions shall be offered the students to pass a course or part of a course (Chapter 6, Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance).

In cases where a course has been discontinued or has undergone major changes, the student shall normally be guaranteed at least three examination occasions (including the ordinary examination) during a period of at least one year from the last time the course was given. This may not be in conflict with Chapter 6 Section 21 of Higher Education Ordinance.
