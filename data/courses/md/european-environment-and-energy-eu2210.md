## Summary

In this course, you will have in-depth knowledge of the economic, judicial, and political conditions for environmental and energy policy-making in the European Union. The course treats and problematizes the European Union's environmental and energy politics. You will be analyzing the European Union's legal foundation, the political process, and the commitments for economic growth and market integration from an environmental perspective.

## About

During this course you will get deeper understanding of the vagueness of sustainable development and in what ways the concept is used by/in the EU. This provides the baseline for thematic elaborations on different environmental and energy problems and future challenges for the EU.

These thematic elaborations will also include analyses of the relation between the EU and the member states, the EU as an international actor, the role of NGO´s and other lobby groups. The thematic elaborations are structured so that they analyze (1) the role of various actors, institutions and interests in the policy process; (2) implementation issues, including the relation between the EU and the member states; and (3) the EU as a global actor, focusing e.g. on the possible conflicts between EU’s policy promotion internationally and the political practices of EU internally as well as in third countries.

The course is sustainability-focused, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg’s confirmed sustainability criteria.

## Prerequisites and selection
