## Summary

War is a reoccurring phenomenon in the history of international relations. Why do wars occur? What measures are available for preventing wars and mitigating their consequences once they occur? This course introduces the scientific study of armed conflict between and within states, and to fundamental approaches of modern conflict management.

## About

The course introduces the study of armed conflict and the principal measures of conflict management. The course covers three main areas:

**First,** basic concepts of war and empirical patterns in inter- and intrastate armed conflict. How are different types of armed conflict defined and in what ways do they vary, over time and space?

**Second,** theories on the sources of armed of conflict and war. How can we explain that states and other actors choose armed strategies, despite their tremendous costs and desctruction? Seminal theories explaining the origins of war at the systemic, state, and individual levels are presented and discussed.

**Third,** fundamental approaches to contemporary conflict management, including mediation, sanctions, and peacekeeping operations. Throughout, the course takes up a number of empirical cases – historical and contemporary – which provide a perspective on the chain from conflict onset to conflict termination.

### Teaching and examination

The course involves lectures, seminars, and simulations. The teaching language is English. Participants will individually compose a paper, which will be presented at least once during the course.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course the student should have obtained 30 credits from courses in political science or international relations and 15 credits from courses in social science. In addition, the students also must have attended 15 credits courses in social sciences, or equivalent. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B or equivalent.

### Selection

- Explain basic theories about interstate and intrastate armed conflicts, including theories at system, state, and individual level.
