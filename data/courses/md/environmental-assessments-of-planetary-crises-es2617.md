## Summary

Environmental assessments are at the intersection between environmental science, policy and society and are crucial to tackling the triple planetary crises of pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. Society needs environmental scientists with knowledge and skills in methodologies used in environmental assessments of the three main planetary crises our planet faces today. This course aims to prepare you to become an environmental expert who can work in sustainability, research or conservation.

## About

In this course, you will learn about the scientific background of several methodologies used for environmental assessments of three planetary crises: pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. The course also introduces students to the different types of scientific assessments delivered to the international platforms and public authorities that shape the monitoring, policy instruments, and management actions associated with these planetary crises.

For each planetary crisis, the course handles (a) the fundamental concepts, methodologies, data sources, and data analysis used for making the environmental assessments, and (b) how these are used by international regulatory authorities and platforms such as ECHA, IPCC or IPBES.

The course attracts students from different parts of the world, which helps students to think more broadly and make international connections in the field of environmental science. This course is taught in the form of lectures, computer exercises, and seminars.
