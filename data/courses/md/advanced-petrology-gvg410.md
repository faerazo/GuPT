## Summary

Petrology is the branch of geology concerned with the compositions, structures, and origins of rocks.

Rocks contain a great deal of information, and the task of a petrologist is to unravel and interpret that information which can be used to investigate the historical and geological evolution of the Earth. This course provides the opportunity to deepen your knowledge in the field and to put theory into practice through case studies and literature studies.

## About

The course focuses on deepening the understanding of the pocesses that control formation of rocks. By combining literature studies and practical application, the principles of petrology from the field to the laboratory and the physical and chemical conditions that control the formation of different rock types are deepened.

The course covers:

- principles of rock-forming processes
- interpretation of complex petrological datasets
- research strategies in petrology

The course is part of the Master’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

**Teaching**

The teaching includes:

- lectures
- group exercises
- laboratory sessions
- presentations


Language of instruction: English

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to the course, completed courses of at least 165 credits in the main field of Earth Sciences are required of which 90% should be completed with at least pass.  Furthermore, a passing grade is required in Bachelor's level courses of Mineralogy 7.5 credits (GVG210), Geochemistry, 7.5 credits (GVG380) and Petrology 7.5 credits (GVG270) or equivalent courses.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

If you study Earth Science, you have good career opportunities both in Sweden and abroad. You can choose to work in industry, as a consultant, project manager or in public administration.

Our former students work, for example, with natural resource management, environmental issues and urban planning, you also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Facilities

The Department of Earth Sciences' premises are located in central Gothenburg on Campus Medicinareberget. We are located in the Natrium building, which was inaugurated in 2023 and has state-of-the-art labs and lecture halls. Natrium brings together students and researchers in the Natural Science fields of Biology, Molecular biology, Chemistry, Marine Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences and Conservation.

## Exchange opportunities

If you are studying Earth Sciences at the University of Gothenburg, there are good opportunities for exchange studies during your studies. This is often seen as a good asset when applying for jobs, as many jobs require international collaboration.

We have over 100 agreements within Erasmus and other exchange programs with universities around the world, both within and outside Europe.
