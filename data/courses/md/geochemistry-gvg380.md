## Summary

The course explores the occurrence and origin of elements in the universe. You will learn about the Big Bang, the formation of the solar system and planets, as well as geochemical cycles with focus on the Earth.

Geochemical classification and distribution of basic elements, geochemical concepts related to isotopes, theory and practice of instrumental analysis are also studied. Furthermore, you will receive an introduction to the micorgeochemical laser laboratory.

## About

In this course you will learn about :

- the chemistry and processes of the Earth and its crust
- the principles of stable and radiogenic isotopes
- basic principles of geochemical analysis and instrumentation
- calculate and evaluate chemical analyses of various minerals
- geological history

The course also includes geochemical analysis using available techniques.

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Earth Sciences, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

**Teaching**

The teaching consists of

- lectures
- lab exercises

Language of instruction: English.

The teaching is carried out by dedicated teachers who are researchers in the field. The course has a strong research and labour market connection, which you as a student will benefit from.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires participation in the courses GVG210 Mineralogy and GVG270 Petrology, of which at least one course must be successfully completed, and at least 90 credits in the main field of Earth Sciences is required. Applicants with equivalent education can, after review and approval, be admitted to the course.
