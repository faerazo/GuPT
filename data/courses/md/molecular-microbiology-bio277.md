## About

This course in Molecular microbiology gives you in-depth knowledge and better understanding of the evolution, cell biology, genetics and molecular biology of microorganisms.

Specific subject areas included in the course are:

- Organization of the bacterial cell, metabolism and growth
- Replication of DNA, variation, evolution and gene expression
- Regulation of gene expression
- Cellular differentiation in prokaryotes
- Molecular mechanisms for different cellular processes
- Molecular biology of yeast fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

After completing the course, you will be able to

- present scientific literature to others
- apply your background knowledge to new topics
- plan an experiment and analyse results of experiments
- write in the format of a scientific paper
- perform a number of standard lab techniques, such as growth curves and genetic analysis.

### Teaching

By taking this course, you are encouraged to actively participate in your education and therefore only a few lectures are held. In activities and seminars, you present and discuss important biological issues based on milestone research papers, reviews or other publications. The experimental work provides you with basic principles of microbiology and bacterial genetics. All students will work in small groups. Lab methods and results will be documented in lab reports.

This course is taught in English.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Completed basic courses in biology comprising 60 credits in the subject areas of cell biology, molecular genetics, evolution, botanical and zoological physiology, ecology and biodiversity and systematics, or equivalent, of which at least 45 credits must be approved. English proficiency is required to the level of English 6/English Course B from Swedish Upper Secondary School, or be certified by an international recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Molecular microbiology is a course in biology at ground level. The course can be included in the following programmes:

- Bachelor's programme in Molecular Biology
- Bachelor's programme in Biology
- Master's programme in Molecular Biology
- Master's programme in Biology
- Master's programme in Genomics and Systems Biology.

The course can also be applied for as a stand-alone course.

Knowledge and skills in molecular microbiology are important if you want to work in microbiology research, education, health care, medical science, environmental protection, bio-production, pharmaceutical industry and bioprocess industry fields.

## Facilities

The course is given on Campus Medicinareberget.
