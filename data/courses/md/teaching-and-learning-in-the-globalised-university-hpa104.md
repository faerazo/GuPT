## Summary

The course offers an in-depth exploration of the role and impact of globalization on higher education, with a focus on identifying and analyzing both the opportunities and challenges that accompany this development.

## About

Grounded in current research on globalization in higher education, the course provides you with a comprehensive understanding of how global trends influence the education sector.

A crucial part of the course is its engagement with critical perspectives on higher education as a geopolitical arena. This includes an examination of the dominant Western framing of research and its limitations. Furthermore, decolonization of education is discussed, exploring its significance for teaching and learning, and how it can contribute to a more inclusive and fair educational environment. The connection between globalization and diversity, the multilingual university, and broadened participation are also considered as central themes. These aspects are illuminated to understand how higher education can adapt and respond to the needs of an increasingly diverse student body and societal structure.

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to explore a specific issue related to globalization in higher education. This allows you to apply a micro-, meso-, or macro-perspective to a topic of interest, contributing to a deeper understanding of the subject and its impact on global education dynamics.

The course is conducted in English, is fully online, runs on part-time, and includes lectures, seminars, and workshops, as well as completing individual and group assignments as part of the course requirements.
