## About

This course will give you a basic introduction to feminist film theory. You will learn about central films, concepts and issues that have been discussed in feminist film studies since the 1970s until the present. The course offers an overview of perspectives such as gaze theory, cinematic language, reception, and queer and postcolonial perspectives.

Furthermore, there will be an introduction to critical tools for discussing these issues in relation to specific cultural and social contexts. You will also get to theoretically assess the current broad discussion about representation, diversity and gender equality in the film industry in Sweden as well as internationally.
