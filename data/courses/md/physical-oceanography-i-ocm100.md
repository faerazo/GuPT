## About

The course gives a basic introduction to the principles governing motion in the the ocean, covering scales from the smallest turbulent eddies to the world ocean circulation. Great emphasis is put on the usage of quantitative mathematical expressions for describing physical phenomena. Many problems of fluid motion demand numerical methods to be solved and the course includes computer exercises in finding numerical solutions.

The course covers the following topics: Basic properties of a fluid in motion (including the governing equations for mass-conservation, momentum and energy), coordinate-systems and effects planetary rotation, simplification of equations using dominant scales of length and time, laminar flow, processes of diffusion, vorticity, geostrophic flows, thermal wind, turbulence, effects of friction, Ekman layers and basic ocean circulation.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

For admission to the course, 120 credits of completed courses within natural sciences are required, of which at least 15 credits in mathematics (analysis and linear algebra).

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
