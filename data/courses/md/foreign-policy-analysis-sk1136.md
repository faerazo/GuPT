## About

This course provides students with the tools to analyse, interpret and explain the dynamics of foreign policy in individual and comparative cases, as well as to relate foreign policy to broader international developments at the global level. Foreign policy decisions, processes and outcomes will be examined at different levels of analysis, ranging from the individual (perceptions and beliefs), the state (regime type, bureaucracy, public opinion) to the system level (balance of power and global governance).

While the course is mainly focused on the foreign policy of states, we will also consider the rise of new non-state actors, like the European Union. The lectures will introduce students to the main theories and concepts of Foreign Policy Analysis, while the seminars will examine the foreign policy process and action in specific case studies.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A successful completion of a minimum of 60 credits Social sciences, or equivalent. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.
