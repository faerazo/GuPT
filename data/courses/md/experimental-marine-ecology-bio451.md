## About

The course integrates zoology and botany and deals with ecological and evolutionary theories, and experimental design / statistics, with special emphasis on marine organisms. The course aims to use the ecological and evolutionary theories as models and predictive tools to formulate hypotheses that are then tested in supervised group work. The course offers a good preparation for the independent degree project because it deals with all aspects of the research process (critical evaluation of previous literature, formulating testable hypotheses, design and execution of experiments, statistical analysis, and written and oral presentation of results).

This course takes place at  [Tjärnö Marine Laboratory](https://www.gu.se/en/tjarno), near Strömstad. Please note that the students pay for food during their stay at the marine research station.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

1) Approved education of 180 credits, corresponding to a Bachelor degree in Marine Science, Biology or Environmental Science.

2) Approved courses (MAR101-112+NTH001) within the first and second year of the Bachelor program in Marine science at the University of Gothenburg. At least 90 of the 120 credits must be passed.

3) Approved basic courses BIO900, Cell Biology 15 credits (ECTS), BIO905, Molecular Genetics, 15 credits, BIO910, Biological Form and Function, 15 credits, BIO915, Ecology and Evolution, 15 credits, and BIO920 Biodiversity and Systematics. At least 60 of the 75 credits must be passed.

4) Approved courses of at least 90 credits in the Bachelor programme in Environmental Sciences at the University of Gothenburg, including BIO915 Ecology and Evolution (15 credits).

In addition to this, for all four alternatives, you need at least one approved advanced level course in biology, 15 credits, in a relevant subject. English 6/B or equivalent is also required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

The Gothenburg region offers proximity to a wide range of marine environments and our facilities include research stations and vessels.

## Recommended study route

The course comprises two integrated elements. A theoretical part with

lectures and seminars deepens knowledge about, and understanding of, ecological

and evolutionary theories, and experimental design / statistics. The

experimental part of the course aims to apply your acquired knowledge through

exercises and individual work.
