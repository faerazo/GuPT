## Course modules

Field studies, 7.5 Credits


Group project, 7.5 Credits


## Position

The course includes 15 credits at master's level. The course may be offered as an elective course subject to availability.

The course can be part of the following programmes:

N2GVS Master's Programme in Earth Sciences

N2ACE Atmopshere, Climate and Ecosystems, Master's Programme

N2MVN Environmental Sciences

## Entry requirements

Admission to the course requires a Bachelor's Degree of 180 credits in Natural Sciences specializing in Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Chemistry or the equivalent, and completion of at least 30 credits at Master's level in Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences or Chemistry. Students with a chemistry background must also have successfully completed at least 15 credits of Earth Sciences at the master's level or 30 credits of Earth Sciences at the bachelor's level or the equivalent.

Furthermore, basic knowledge of statistical analysis and programming equivalent to GV2500 Data Analysis for Earth Sciences, 7,5 credits, is required.

Students with an equivalent education may be admitted to the course after review and approval.

## Content

The course provides advanced and applied knowledge of the key Earth system processes in relation to a changing Earth and climate. The course explores concepts linked to the interactions between vegetation, soils, ecosystem change and climate at various scales. Key issues within Earth System Science are addressed, including terrestial ecosystem structure and function, biogeochemical cycles of the key elements, climate and human impact on the Earth system.

The course has a strong emphasis on providing important field training and developing practical skills. Field studies in a non-Nordic country, c. 2 weeks in duration, forms the principal component of the course and offers a hands-on experience with sampling and measurement of fundamental environmental properties, including soils, landforms, vegetation and climate, as well as opportunities to familiarize oneself with modern field techniques.

Working in teams, students will design and undertake their own, fully supervised, short research projects linked to the Earth system aspect of the course. The projects will consist of a full scientific research cycle, including planning, field wor, analysis of data, and report writing and oral communication of project results.

## Objectives

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

_Knowledge and understanding_

- Describe and explain fundamental natural processes, and how they relate to the Earth system at various scales.
- Demonstrate practical and analytical research competence by intergrating the academic knowledge of Earth system phenomena with direct field and laboratory observations.

_Competence and skills_

- Demonstrate advanced capacity to design and plan field investigations incorporating a range of relevant field methods and techniques.
- Demonstrate an ability to analyze and draw nuanced interpretations from relevant Earth systems data.
- Communicate synthesized research findings orally and in writing.

_Judgement and approach_

- Critically assess the validity of a range of field sampling techniques.
- Judge the reliability of collected field-data.
- Critically examine other reports both orally and in writing.

## Sustainability labelling

The course is sustainability-focused, which means that at least one of the learning outcomes clearly shows that the course content meets at least one of the University of Gothenburg’s confirmed sustainability criteria. The content also constitutes the course's main focus.


## Form of teaching

Throughout the course, students will work in groups to conceptualize, conduct, and present a field research project of their own design.

The pre-field teaching consist of lectures, compulsory seminars and field preparations including method training and research planning.

During the c. 2-week mandatory field trip, lectures and hands-on teaching occur on location. The acquired theoretical knowledge is applied to the concrete group-based field investigations. During the field work, the students present what has been done by writing individual diaries which should include reflections on their own process and learning.

Post field activities includes laboratory analysis of the field data, synthesis and interpretation of results, and communication of the research findings in oral format and as a formal summary report.

Language of instruction: English

## Examination formats

Field studies, 7,5 credits: Active attendance in compulsory activities, such as seminars and the field trip, and a self-reflective written report, (U/G).

Group project, 7,5 credits: Written report and oral presentation, (U/G/VG).

Detailed guidelines and assessment criteria for the project work are med available for the student in a course guide.

If a student who has twice received a failing grade for the same examination component wishes to change examiner ahead of the next examination session, such a request should be made to the department in writing and should be approved by the department unless there are special reasons to the contrary (Chapter 6 Section 22 of the Higher Education Ordinance).

If a student has received a recommendation from the University of Gothenburg for study support for students with disabilities, the examiner may, where it is compatible with the learning outcomes of the course and provided that no unreasonable resources are required, decide to allow the student to sit an adjusted exam or alternative form of assessment.

In the event that a course has ceased or undergone major changes, students are to be guaranteed at least three examination sessions (including the ordinary examination session) over a period of at least one year, but no more than two years after the course has ceased/been changed. The same applies to internships and professional placements (VFU), although this is restricted to just one additional examination session.

## Grades

The grading scale comprises: Pass with Distinction (VG), Pass (G) and Fail (U).

For the grade Pass (G) for the entire course, a passing grade is required for both graded sections. To receive the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) for the final grade, the grade Pass with Distinction (VG) for the group project work as well as Pass (G) for the field studies is required.

## Course evaluation

Students are given the opportunity for an anonymous , written evaluation of the course.

The results of and possible changes to the course will be shared with students who participated in the evaluation and students who are starting the course.

## Other regulations

Students admitted to N2GVS Master's Programme in Earth Sciences and N2ACE Atmopshere, Climate and Ecosystems, Master's Programme, are given priority to the course.
