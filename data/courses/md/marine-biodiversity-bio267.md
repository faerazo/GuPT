## Summary

Get to know marine organisms! You will learn how to identify sea-living animals and plants, both macroscopical and microscopical ones, and you will learn where they live (in the free water, on rocky bottoms, in soft bottoms, etc.). You will also get accustomed to literature for identifying marine organisms.

## About

The course provides knowledge on the collection and identification of marine animals and plants and about the biotopes they live in.  The course provides an introduction to the common species in Swedish water, as well as to the literature of identification and nomenclature for the various organism groups and is divided into five sub-courses covering marine benthic invertebrates (7.5 credits), zooplankton (2 credits), macroalgae (2 credits), microalgae (2 credits) and fish (1.5 credits). It is an applied course with a lot of field and laboratory work. Basic taxonomic theory will also be presented (phylogeny and nomenclature). The course takes place at Tjärnö Marine Laboratory ( [www.gu.se/en/tjarno](https://www.gu.se/en/tjarno)). Please note that the students pay for food during staying at the marine research station
