## About

The student will be familiar with with individual manuscripts in facsimile as well as critical editions, while studying the principles behind the text editions.

The student is also trained in applying basic text-critical principles to selected texts. During the course, the student will problematise original text, autograph, copies, and canonical textform in relation to the diversity and fluidity that is visible in biblical text traditions.
