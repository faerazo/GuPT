## Summary

This is a master’s thesis course for you that are undertaking a two-year master’s degree in Global Studies, and have taken a course in research design and methods where you have developed a thesis proposal. In this course, you will learn to conduct a qualified and scientific study based on your proposal, and develop, exercise and demonstrate an expertise in the particular field of the thesis, as well as a general scholarly competence.

## About

At the onset of the course, you will be assigned a supervisor based on your thesis project proposal. The supervisor will provide substantive guidance in the fine-tuning of your research questions, your collection of data, and will provide feedback on your analysis and on the thesis as a whole. Your research and writing will provide you with in-depth expertise in your particular area of specialization, and will increase your ability to analyse a problem scientifically as well as write and argue scientifically. You will also learn to position yourself in relation to the ongoing debate concerning your chosen research problem. In the final thesis seminars where you defend your thesis you will have a chance to practice arguing for your ideas verbally, and also have the opportunity to verbally analyse and examine the thesis of a peer.

The focus of this course is specifically on the writing of a master’s thesis within the field of Global Studies, which includes Development Studies, Global Gender Studies, Human Ecology, International Conflict Resolution, International Relations, and Social Anthropology; and the relevance of your chosen topic to global studies should be demonstrated in the thesis.
