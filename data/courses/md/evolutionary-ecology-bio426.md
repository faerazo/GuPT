## About

Evolution permeates all aspects of life and modern views of biology, from molecular interactions, genetic and non-genetic inheritance, development and its extensions, to inter-individual and population level processes, resulting in speciation and phylogenetic divergence. Using expert researchers, we pick the cherries from these disciplines and create an integrative course with a bottom-up approach (molecular-to-evolutionary process thinking), linked to a top-down perspective (explaining phylogenetics and biodiversity).

In the middle, sandwiched between these frameworks, is Evolutionary Ecology. Here we make theoretical use of molecular methods for tracing paternity and identifying poor (or superior) genetic combinations during selection in free-ranging animals, to understanding constraints to evolution (why it doesn’t happen when it should), how and why mate choice results in poor (or ‘perfect’) offspring, shorter or longer lifespan, why evolutionary rates can be extraordinarily rapid when you least expect, and why radiation of taxa sometimes happens while we watch in real time, and sometimes never at all (stasis).

These questions are rooted in evolutionary theory and statistical (quantitative) genetics, and developed into approaches for statistical control of phylogenetic dependence of important phenotypic traits. These methods are also critical for understanding paradigms and criteria for extinction avoidance in modern conservation biology. The course is held in English, which gives the broad range of advanced students with diverse interests from across Europe a chance to engage and forge friendships and networks for future interaction and collaboration in a ‘think-tank’ friendly environment.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be accepted on the course the following education (or equivalent) is required:

Alternative 1: Approved basic courses BIO900 Cell Biology (15 hec), BIO905 Molecular Genetics (15 hec), BIO910 Biological Form and Function (15 hec), BIO915 Ecology and Evolution (15 hec), and BIO920 Biodiversity and Systematics (15 hec).

Alternative 2: Approved courses ES1201 Environmental Sciences: Natural Science (15 hec), ES1300 Natural Resources Management (15 hec), ES1305 Pollutants effects and dispersal on Biological Systems (15 hec), BIO915 Ecology and Evolution (15 hec), and at least one approved course of the following options: BIO900 Cell Biology (15 hec), BIO905 Molecular Genetics (15 hec), BIO910 Biological Form and Function (15 hec), or BIO920 Biodiversity and Systematics (15 hec).

Alternative 3: Approved courses totalling at least 90 hec within the two first years of the Marine Sciences Bachelor's Programme, University of Gothenburg.

In addition to any of the 3 alternatives above, at least one approved course (15 hec) in Biology at the Bachelor level, in a relevant subject, is required. For example: BIO214 Dynamics in Natural Populations, BIO209 Behavioural Biology, BIO217 Evolutionary Biology, or equivalent.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B).

## Recommended study route

Teaching takes place through lectures, seminars (research presentations), various digital media, exercises and group discussions.
