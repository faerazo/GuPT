## About

Ecotoxicology studies the effects of chemicals on non-human organisms within an ecosystem. You will learn the fundamentals of ecotoxicology as a scientific discipline, providing knowledge concerning environmental chemicals, methods to study the nature and extent of environmental pollution, and the fundamental techniques necessary to quantify toxic effects on biological systems of various levels of complexity (individuals, populations and ecological communities).

Ecotoxicology also provides the fundamental scientific basis for ecological risk assessments. Therefor during the course you will also get knowledge about the corresponding regulatory frameworks for ecotoxicology. Finally, the course will highlight and discuss the role of ecotoxicology within the wider context of neighboring scientific disciplines (e.g. human toxicology, environmental law).

The course will make extensive use of problem-based and project-based learning approaches, including independent recherché on various subjects, discussion and presentations of specific subjects, data analyses, discussions and group project work.

The course consists of four subparts:

1) Lectures, which are not compulsory, but whose content will provide the basis for the following quizzes, seminars, exercises and the final exam (4 HEC).

2) Compulsory elements, in the form of e.g. quizzes, computer exercises, literature seminars including presentations and other similar moments as outlined in the course schedule. Students that do not take part in compulsory elements of the course are required to submit written summaries of the content of these moments to pass the course (4 HEC).

3) A written report and oral presentation (group task) on a specific topic, which will be distributed at the beginning of the course (4 HEC)

4) Final individual exam on the content of 1) and 2), in written form (hall exam, 3 HEC).
