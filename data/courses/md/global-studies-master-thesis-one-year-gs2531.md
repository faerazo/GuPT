## Summary

This is a master’s thesis course for you that are undertaking a one-year master’s degree in Global Studies, and have taken a course in research design and methods where you have developed a thesis proposal.

Your research and writing will provide you with in-depth expertise in your particular area of specialization, and will increase your ability to analyse a problem scientifically as well as write and argue scientifically. You will also learn to position yourself in relation to the ongoing debate concerning your chosen research problem.
