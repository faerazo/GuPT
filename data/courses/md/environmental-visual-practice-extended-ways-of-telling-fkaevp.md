## Summary

This course focuses on visual storytelling related to environmental issues such as climate change, sustainable futures and the relationship between humans and the natural world. This is an advanced level course intended for students who wish to develop visual methods and storytelling tools for communicating and conveying knowledge about environmental issues.

## About

The course focuses on developing interactivity between scientific and artistic modes of storytelling and communicating. Students will develop more sophisticated and innovative ways of communicating with XR techniques in combination with digital and spatial composition. The course is interdisciplinary, and participating students will explore methods and exchange experiences of storytelling and visualisation in the area of the course theme.

The course is rooted in a historical survey of the relationship between art and science in the development of scientific fieldwork. Each student will independently plan and execute a minor field study, including documenting and showing their work in a designed presentation.

The curriculum includes guest lectures and collaboration with established institutions in the surrounding society, such as museums, archives and collections. The course is related to Agenda 2030 and work with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
