## About

The course will give insight into how plasmas are created, where they appear and will try to develop a physical understanding of the characteristic properties of plasmas. An important part of the course is to illustrate plasma physics concepts and phenomena by considering applications ranging from fusion energy generation and microwave techniques to space physics and astrophysics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

To be eligible for the course ASM440 the student needs knowledge in mathematics and physics equivalent to a Bachelor's degree. The student should also be familiar with electromagnetic field theory. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.
