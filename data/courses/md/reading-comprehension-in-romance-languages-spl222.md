## About

The course provides reading comprehension in at least two Romance languages in addition to your main language and aims to develop your reading skills mainly with a focus on news texts and academic texts. The main language is the language with which you have been admitted to the course.

Through both a typologic and a contrastive approach, the course focuses on differences and similarities in syntax, morphology, lexicon and phonology between the Romance languages, to give a basic understanding of the properties of the different languages.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

The requirement for admission to the course is completed 90 credits in a Romance language. Language skills equivalent to English 6 and Swedish 3 are also required.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

What happens next? Further studies? Apply for a degree? Search for a job? How can you plan forwards to get your dream job?

There are many questions, and some answers can be found here:
