## About

This course gives an introduction to experimental design and sampling theory. In experimental design we will learn how to construct various types of designs, such as factorial design, mixed-effect models, split-plot designs and response surface methods, as well as statistical analysis methods such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear and non-linear regression. In sampling theory we treat different types of sampling strategies, such as simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, weighted sampling and cluster sampling, and the subsequent analysis such as population and variance estimates, model based inference and pseudo-likelihood methods.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Knowledge corresponding to the courses MMG200 Mathematics 1, MSG200 Statistical Inference, and MSG500 Linear Statistical Models.

### Selection

All eligible applicants who have applied before the deadline will be granted a place.

## Facilities

Mathematical Sciences is a joint department of Chalmers/University of Gothenburg. Your education takes place in the spacious and bright premises of Mathematical Sciences at the Chalmers campus Johanneberg, where there are lecture halls, computer rooms and group rooms. Here you can also find student lunch room and reading room, as well as student counsellors and student office.
