## About

The digitalization of society is rapidly transforming not only the way

we relate to and use technology, but also the manner in which we

organize,  manage, lead, interact, live et cetera. In order to

comprehend the often-times dramatic changes, research offers a long and

fruitful tradition of inquiry. In this course, we will provide you as

students and participants with the opportunity to trace the underlying

foundations in terms of theories that have impacted and impact

digitalization. Our researchers will share their individual research

foundations, the theories and underlying insights that they use in their

everyday study of the digitalization of society. The idea is to provide

you as a student and participant in the course with the opportunity to

see further and deeper, to be more nuanced when you approach the issue

of the digitalization of society. What are the theoretical foundations

of RPA or AI for instance? Of digital transformation and agile? Of

recommender systems and blockchain? This is what the course offers, and

we hope that it will allow you to further your understanding of the

digitalization of society.

The language of instruction is English. All activities in the course are conducted remotely and asynchronously.
