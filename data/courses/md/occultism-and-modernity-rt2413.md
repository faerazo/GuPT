## About

The course will focus on modern forms of Western esotericism from 18th century Freemasonry to esoteric New Religious Movements such as the modern Witchcraft movement (Wicca), Satanism and the New Age Movement. More specifically, the course will consider how esoteric practitioners responded to major changes in Western religion and spirituality due to the processes of modernity and secularization.
