## About

The course includes basic knowledge of evolutionary patterns and processes, with examples from different levels of biological organization (molecules, organisms, populations, species and higher taxa) . Examples of evolution in many different life forms such as bacteria, archaea, "protists", fungi, plants and animals, and in different types of habitat (aquatic and terrestrial, natural and anthropogenic) are given. The development of the tree of life through different geological eras and the methods used to track this development is a key part of the course. Another important aspect is the understanding of evolutionary mechanisms that exist within species and populations over short intervals of time (generations), and the methods used to study such processes. The course also describes the consequences of biological evolution in modern human society, such as the development of bacterial resistance, adaptability of species under environmental change, and genetic effects of breeding in plants and animals. In the course we also discuss the importance of evolution for man in society.
