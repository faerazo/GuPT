## Summary

Would you like to learn how humanity is affected by climate change? Then this is the course for you.

Which regions are most vulnerable and how can we adapt to a warmer climate? The course includes a field trip to the Mediterranean region where theoretical knowledge is complemented by field observations.

## About

Melting ice in Greenland, drought in Australia, late or no monsoon in Asia, severe fires in the Mediterranean. What impact will these events have on people and society? You will gain hands-on experience of the tools needed to make a comprehensive analysis of how a region is affected by a changing climate.

The course consists of four modules:

**1\. Theory**

This module deals with the impact of climate and environmental change on people and the environment in different regions from the Arctic to the tropics. You will learn about the large-scale climate pattern and changes in the different climate zones, as well as the vulnerability and adaptive capacity to a warmer world.

The course also adresses specific issues such as water resources, desertification, ocean acidification, migration, pollution, urbanisation and impacts on society.

**2\. Excursion to the Mediterranean**

You will develop your theoretical knowledge through field observations and visits to key stakeholders in the region. You will apply the theoretical knowledge to a region and present issues related to the course content.

The Mediterranean region is highly affected by environmental and climate change.

The excursion will involve additional costs for you as a student. If you are a programme student, you can apply for a scholarship from the Adlerbertska Foundations.

[More information about Adlerbert scholarships](https://studentportal.gu.se/english/help-and-guidance/finances/scholarships-and-grants/?selectedSegment=the-adlerbert-scholarships&languageId=100001&skipSSOCheck=true&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gu.se%2F).

**3\. Data analysis**

Tutored computer exercises and analysis using Excel and GIS.

**4\. Project work**

Project work in groups using data analysis and GIS. The project will be presented orally and in writing.

The course is part of the Bachelor’s Programme in Geography, the course is also offered as a freestanding course.

## After graduation

Geographers often work with urban planning, environmental management or broader issues related to sustainable development, in Sweden or internationally. As a geographer, you may work on planning new public transport, roads, water supply or urban planning for climate change. Geographers can be found in business, government and international organizations.

Our former students work, for example, as environmental consultants, coordinators, urban planners and GIS consultants. You also have great opportunities to focus on the particular area you are interested in.

## Exchange opportunities

If you are studying Geography at the University of Gothenburg, there are good opportunities for exchange studies during your studies. This is often seen as a good asset when applying for jobs, as many jobs require international collaboration.
