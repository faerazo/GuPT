## About

During the course, you will learn more about:

- Important quantum algorithms such as Quantum Fourier transform, Phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm.
- Variational quantum algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), and the Quantum Approximate Optimisation algorithms (QAOA), among others.
- The intersection of quantum computing and machine learning.

The course will also give the students practical experience of programming a quantum computer.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelors degree in Physics, or equivalent, including course in quantum mechanics.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
