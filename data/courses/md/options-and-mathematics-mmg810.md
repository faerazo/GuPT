## About

In this course you will get an introduction to mathematical finance with an emphasis on stock and currency options. The basic concepts of mathematical finance, such as arbitrage, self-financing strategies, hedging, etc, will be defined clearly in the context of the binomial model, where the stock process is a geometric random walk. When the number of periods in the binomial model goes to infinity, we obtain the famous Black-Scholes model.

## Prerequisites and selection
