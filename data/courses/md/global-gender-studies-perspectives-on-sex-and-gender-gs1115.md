## Summary

The course is an introduction to gender issues in a global perspective. Apply for courses in global gender studies if you aim to specialize in challenges related to gender issues.

## About

The course is an introduction to gender issues in a global perspective. You will become familiar with theories and concepts that can be used to understand and interpret sex and gender in a globalised world. We introduce and explore key concepts in gender studies, such as sex, gender, feminism, masculinity/femininity, queer, trans, heteronormativity and intersectionality. You will also give you an overview of the academic disciplines that have formulated and studied these concepts and how these subjects have related to development and globalisation processes.

The teaching in Global Gender Studies takes the form of lectures and seminars. In the seminars you

will get the opportunity to deepen your understanding and let your views

be confronted with the perspectives of other students. A fundamental

part of the courses' design is continuous writing assignments, which

give you an opportunity to develop your own thinking and writing. The

courses are held in English with both Swedish and international

students.
