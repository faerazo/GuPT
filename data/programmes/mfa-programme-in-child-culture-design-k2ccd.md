## Summary

The unique master’s programme in Child Culture Design delves into the intersection of design and children's perspectives, with a strong emphasis on the activity of play. As a student, you will develop innovative projects for and with children, applying multidisciplinary research and knowledge to your design work. Grounded in social sustainability and aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, this program empowers you to become a key player in shaping a better world for future generations. Child Culture Design plays seriously.

## About

The Child Culture Design programme is a two-year advanced-level design education that emphasizes the value of deeply understanding a specific target group to create more impactful and meaningful projects for both users and society.

Launched in 2009, Child Culture Design is a unique and growing field, distinct in its multidisciplinary approach and its focus on artistic design practices that are specifically tailored to children.

With a strong emphasis on play, children's perspectives, and their unique circumstances, our master’s program stands apart. We aim to merge design and artistic practice with child culture, fostering a deep understanding of this specific user group. A cornerstone of our program is the commitment to creating a sustainable society—not only in ecological terms but also in promoting social equality, gender equality, ethics, economy, and social justice.

### **Comprehensive Learning Opportunities**

In our program, the relationship between children’s culture and child culture is critically examined to better integrate design with the concept of child culture. Through an array of lectures, seminars, and hands-on projects, you will engage with multidisciplinary research and learn to apply research findings to your design projects.

Your practical and theoretical skills will be honed through projects, seminars, workshops, and thematic work, along with individual assignments. Many of these activities involve collaboration with external partners and cover diverse areas such as the design of children's environments, products, toys, outdoor play objects, children's books and illustrations, new media, and participatory processes and methods.

### A Collaborative, Creative, and Inspiring Learning Environment

Collaboration is at the heart of Child Culture Design. We work closely with organizations and other stakeholders involved in cultural production for children—such as cultural institutions (museums, libraries), municipalities, city planners, and companies specializing in play, toys, and children’s books.

We welcome students from a wide range of backgrounds, including traditional design disciplines, architecture, fine art, crafts, and beyond. Child Culture Design is a melting pot of diverse experiences, skills, and cultural perspectives, all working together to make the world a better place for children.

### Selection

The selection is based on an assessment of submitted work samples.

## After graduation

Upon completion of the programme, you will be awarded a Master of Fine Arts degree with a major in Child Culture Design.

With your specialized knowledge in play, child culture, and children’s perspectives, you will be well-equipped to pursue a career as a designer. This expertise can be applied in traditional design fields such as product and industrial design, interior design, or graphic design.

However, our program goes beyond the conventional, encouraging you to push the boundaries of design and explore new avenues. You will have the tools to forge your own unique path, whether within established industries or in emerging, interdisciplinary fields. Additionally, your degree qualifies you to apply for post-graduate studies, should you wish to further your academic journey.
