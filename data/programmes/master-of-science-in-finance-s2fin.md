## Summary

The master’s programme in Finance is designed to equip students with a strong foundation in analytical and empirical analysis, and to educate them more generally about the research process in finance and related disciplines. The valuation concepts and techniques taught to you have proven applicability even outside the traditional investment banking community. Courses in the programme aim to provide deeper knowledge and operational understanding of concepts and techniques, thereby enabling you to apply them to practical problems.

## About

Financial questions arise almost everywhere in modern life. Individuals must manage their income, expenses, savings, and investments. Companies must run their financial operations in such a way that all stakeholders benefit, including employees, owners, and the surrounding community. Globally, we must establish socially responsible investment practices that provide resources for tackling issues like poverty and environmental sustainability. The skills developed during the master’s programme in Finance help you to provide educated answers to these various challenges.

### Professionally oriented

Our programme focuses on the problems of an advanced practitioner and provides you with a solid basis in corporate finance and investment management. You will gain analytical knowledge and an operational understanding of financial concepts, develop skills to apply financial theory to practical problems, and gather working knowledge of empirical tools. Prominent representatives of the business community give seminars and classes, preparing you to enter the job market. Our Finance Laboratory modernizes your education by:

- providing access to real-time data from most global exchanges;
- providing a continuous flow of updated models and research material from several international investment banks, covering most major companies and fixed income securities;
- enabling you to monitor realistic positions of securities in terms of valuation and risk;
- and developing your programming skills to meet the needs of an increasingly technological industry.

### Flexible

You can choose from various elective courses and tailor your education to your particular interests and goals. Courses like Applied Portfolio Management, Quantitative Finance, and Credit Risk Modelling prepare you for careers in asset management, risk management, security analysis, and sales. On the other hand, courses like Corporate Valuation, Financial Accounting, and Industrial Economics prepare you for careers in commercial banking, management consulting, or finance functions in corporations. You may also broaden your perspective via a wide selection of non-financial elective courses.

### International

An international atmosphere allows you to experience other cultures, improve your communication skills, and build a global network of friends. You will be part of a multicultural classroom. We also offer the chance to apply for a Double Degree programme with the Tor Vergata University of Rome, where selected students spend the second year of the programme in Italy and earn a master’s degree from each university. You can also spend an exchange semester in one of our partner universities located around the world. More programme specific information about possibilities to study abroad can be found under Exchange opportunities.

## Programme structure and content

The programme consists of seven mandatory courses that provide you with the fundamentals of economic and financial analysis. The first semester includes courses in Math, Microeconomics, Econometrics, and Financial Markets and Institutions. The second semester starts with Financial Econometrics and Investments, and the third semester starts with Advanced Corporate Finance.

During the remaining parts of the second and third semesters, you will choose from a variety of elective courses that provide an opportunity to tailor your education to your particular interests. You can, for example, choose courses that develop your quantitative skills or courses that focus more on issues relating to corporate governance or finance.

The fourth semester is dedicated to your master's thesis, where you apply your acquired skills to analyze relevant economic questions and have the opportunity to reflect the specialization you built throughout previous semesters.
