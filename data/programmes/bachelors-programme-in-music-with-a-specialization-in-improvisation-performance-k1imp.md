## Summary

The bachelor's programme in music specialising in improvisation is offered for all instruments. This programme caters to students wanting to develop their own style of improvising and their own compositions. Reflection on your creativity and your artistic choices is an important element, and you are encouraged to move towards increasingly independent musical expression and creation.

The programme is taught in English and Swedish.

## About

The programme is international, which means that we are open to applicants without qualifications in Swedish language. The language of instruction will be, if required, English.

The education aims to develop and inspire your personal artistry as an improvising and composing musician, as well as to give you the prerequisites required to gain a strong identity in today's music industry. You will have individual lessons in your main instrument, and great emphasis is on developing your ability to perform with others. The ensemble courses offer a wide field of improvisational music that often transcend genres. We start from a broad interpretation of the concept of jazz – as a language and historical context or as a mind-set, a musical gathering where we are in a state of constant motion and change.

In addition to your primary teacher, you may also receive instruction from teachers with expertise in other areas. With a small number of students admitted to each class, we can focus on the individual students through mentoring and elective courses: To a large extent, you shape your own education. Along the way, you can make changes and choose who you want as a teacher and what you want to focus on. The programme prepares you for a working life as a freelancer and it can prepare you for master’s level studies.

### Structure and Content

**Major instrument and ensemble**

The focus is on developing and artistically deepening your knowledge of your primary instrument, and you are given great opportunities to determine the direction of your own curriculum. The programme includes independent work as well as ensemble playing, in which you develop your personal musical language in collaboration with others. During the education programme, you carry out a thesis project (15 HEC) in which you investigate a chosen question/issue through your musical practice.

**Artistic Theory and Practice**

Music theory in jazz and other genres, including your own composing, holds a prominent place, as does the history of improvisational music with a view to improvisation in other forms of music. Courses such as music theory, ear training, artistic immersion, music and society, future role as a professional, teaching music and multimedia are included.

The course is taught partly in project form, wherein knowledge of and experience with the improvisational musician’s range of working opportunities plays a prominent role. For example, you get to participate in a creative project with record recording and tour. The education also collaborates with Bohuslän Big Band by carrying out a project every year where the students write music for the band and together perform the compositions in a large concert.

**Elective course**

You have the opportunity to broaden or deepen your knowledge through a variety of elective subject areas.
