## Summary

Our Master's programme in Chemistry allows you to create your own unique scientific profile according to your interests and future goals. You can also study the predefined track in neurobiochemistry, an interdisciplinary education between chemistry, molecular biology and medicine. Current research is incorporated into the teaching. You will have the opportunity to practise your learning and develop a specialization with the possibility to perform an individual laboratory-based project of up to one year in one of our top research groups.

## About

Chemistry is crucial to developing a sustainable society. By creating new drugs and new materials that are recyclable, environmentally friendly, and energy efficient, chemists have the opportunity to solve global challenges, both within health and medicine and related to climate and the environment.

### An in-depth and well-rounded education

Our master’s programme provides a deep and up-to-date understanding of chemistry and you will learn to use advanced experimental and theoretical methods. Analysing complex processes at the atomic level and their intricate relationships will sharpen your skills. Such fundamental knowledge is useful for many modern applications like the following:

- synthesis of organic compounds for drug delivery

- synthesis of new nanomaterials

- enhancing the functionality of materials used in industrial processes by tuning their surface and interfacial properties

- development of novel analytical tools for environmental and bioanalytical analysis

- development of new modelling approaches and simulations for complex systems

- design, production, and structural determination of biomolecules.

### Teaching

We emphasize close contact with teachers and researchers, teaching in small groups and using problem-based learning methods in the form of mini projects. You will develop your critical and analytical thinking through project work and your communication skills through oral and written presentations of scientific material. You will put theory into practice during our many laboratory courses, allowing you to develop strong experimental skills. At the end of the programme, you will perform an individual degree project of up to one year within one of our top research groups.

All courses are taught in English.

### Create a unique scientific profile

Our programme consists of both mandatory and elective courses, allowing you to deepen your knowledge in your field or broaden your knowledge by adding other natural science subjects to your curriculum. You can also choose to study any other subject taught at the University of Gothenburg, such as economics, leadership, or a new language. This enables you to create a unique interdisciplinary degree, letting you stand out on the job market.

### Why study Chemistry at the University of Gothenburg?

1. Teaching in small groups and in close contact with your instructors
2. Problem-based learning and laboratory-intensive courses connected to ongoing research
3. The opportunity to tailor your education to your interests and create a unique profile.

Studying chemistry in Sweden has the added benefit of contributing to a more gender-equal field, with more equitable funding and opportunities for further education and employment.

### Top 75 worldwide in Life Sciences—Biological Sciences

In the field of Life Sciences—Biological Sciences, the University of Gothenburg ranks amongst the top 3 universities in Sweden and top 75 worldwide in the ShanghaiRanking 2024. Biological sciences include biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysics, cell biology, and microbiology.

### Scholarship - Pioneering Women in STEM

For the 2025 intake, a special scholarship is available exclusively **for women from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam**. The scholarship will be awarded to one admitted student who has good study results in her bachelor’s degree.

[Read more about how to apply and what the scholarship covers on Swedish Institute's website](https://si.se/en/apply/scholarships/pioneeringwomeninstem/).

## Programme structure and content

During the **first academic year**, you take courses corresponding to 60 higher education credits. You can choose from all our courses and create your own unique chemistry program. You can also choose the interdisciplinary track neurobiochemistry, including courses in chemistry, molecular biology and medicine.

During the **second academic year**, you perform an individual degree project of 30, 45 or 60 higher education credits in one of our research groups, with the opportunity to specialize in the area you are most interested in:

- analytical chemistry

- atmospheric science

- biochemistry and structural biology
- inorganic chemistry

- organic chemistry

- physical chemistry.

## Who should apply?

Are you a natural problem solver who wants to contribute to finding solutions for global issues like diseases and environmental challenges?

Are you curious about how chemistry can influence change?

Do you see yourself working with research and development or with nature conservation and environmental protection?

If you want to gain the knowledge and skills needed to meet future global challenges occurring in all sectors, such as health, energy, climate, and the environment, apply for the Master’s Programme in Chemistry.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree in Science with a minimum of 90 credits in chemistry, or equal qualifications. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation
