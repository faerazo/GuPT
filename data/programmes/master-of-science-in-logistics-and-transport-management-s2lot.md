## Summary

The master’s programme in Logistics and Transport Management challenges your critical thinking and analytical skills. As a student of the programme, you will analyse real-world and theoretical problems, developing skills to design solutions for organizations operating under uncertainty and facing complex and rapidly changing markets and technologies. You will gain a strategic perspective of the relationships, flows, chains, processes, and systems comprising the international logistics and transport arena, with sustainability as a key issue.

## About

Logistics and Transport Management is increasingly recognised as pivotal to sound decision-making and organisational success in meeting business objectives. Complex challenges arise from the globalisation of production and consumption; innovative, modern solutions are needed to ensure and maintain profitability and competitiveness while responding to evolving customer demands and technological developments. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns introduce a whole new dynamic, both socially and practically, to the logistics and transport arena. This programme prepares you for a career in the logistics and transport sector, which employs six million people in the EU alone, has an added value of approximately €15 billion, influences virtually all industrial and public-sector activities, and affects every citizen’s daily life.

### Flexible and comprehensive education

Courses reveal how industry and government decision makers can respond to vigorous international competition, more diverse and demanding consumers, and increasing environmental concerns by applying interorganisational cooperative strategies, modern information technologies, new business processes, and contemporary analytical tools. There are excellent opportunities for designing the programme to fit your own personal interests and goals, including the possibility to undertake exchange studies. Guest lecturers—from senior industry representatives to prominent overseas experts—share their invaluable experiences and intellectually stimulating, cutting-edge content. Significant emphasis is placed on using real-world examples and case studies, many of which are undertaken in close cooperation with industry. Your master´s thesis provides the opportunity to apply your knowledge towards your chosen focus. You may choose to collaborate with an external partner in Sweden or abroad.

### Diverse and valuable practical experience

As a student of this programme, you will benefit from our strong research and educational links with the logistics industry locally, nationally, and globally. The programme prepares you for multifaceted challenges, requiring a balance between theoretical and practical skills, examining real-world case studies and cooperating with established businesses from the logistics community. Here, you will pursue independent work as well as collaborating with fellow students from different educational backgrounds and nationalities, gaining fresh insights and diverse perspectives. The core faculty is supplemented by prominent international visiting professors and representatives of the business community.

### International

An international atmosphere allows you to experience other cultures, improve your communication skills, and build a global network of friends. You will be part of a multicultural classroom. Also you will have the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partner universities.
