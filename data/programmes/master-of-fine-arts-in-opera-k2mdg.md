## Summary

The master’s programme in Opera is for those who have a bachelor’s degree in opera and want to deepen their professional skills during two years. As a student of the programme, you will deepen your artistic abilities and knowledge through coaching, mentorship, and observing and performing in opera productions. As part of the programme, you will take part in a full scale opera production at the Academy of Music and Drama or in an opera house.

## About

The master’s programme in Opera aims to deepen and refine your artistry as a singer and opera performer. We collaborate closely with Swedish opera houses, providing opportunities for individual coaching, mentorship, and the chance to observe opera productions. Several courses within the programme are collaborative with other programmes in music, which helps to broaden your perspective and skillset. The programme includes one semester where you will continue your learning by performing in an opera production. In addition to individual singing lessons and rehearsing, you will have individual tutorials in performance and regular coaching by internationally established guest teachers.

Thus, the programme consists of four main elements:

- Vocal Performance
- Stage Performance
- Opera singers practice
- Independent Work: Degree Project

### Vocal Performance

Courses in vocal performance include individual singing lessons, role studies, master classes, and language coaching and provide the opportunity for you to critically reflect on your own and others’ artistic approaches and develop new and individual ways of expression. There is also a course in core values which is presented together with other master’s programmes. Our collaboration with the Gothenburg Opera provides the opportunity for you to receive individual coaching and mentoring in addition to the chance to observe professional opera productions.

### Stage Performance

Every semester you will work with an opera director with stage performance, both individually and in groups. Sometimes, you are also part of an opera production together with the bachelor’s programme in Opera. This element of the programme also includes physical exercise and dance.

### Opera singers practice

During this course, focus is on the professional role including among other things audition moments and a role in an opera production at the Academy of Music and Drama or as an internship at an opera house.

### Independent Work: Degree Project

Your independent degree project provides the opportunity for you to demonstrate your ability to independently and creatively formulate new questions, contribute to knowledge development, and solve more advanced problems, as you focus on a question or artistic problem in opera in a methodical way. You will work on it throughout the programme in parallel to your other courses, allowing you to develop the text in dialogue with your other artistic work.
