## Summary

This programme will provide you with a high-level toolkit for understanding and analysing complex economic problems. You will be prepared for a career as a professional economist in industry or public sector or, as a PhD student. During the programme you will have the opportunity to apply your skills in a real-world setting during an internship.

You will be prepared to analyze the big issues in society, such as climate change and world poverty – and the small ones, such as competition restrictions or individual behaviour.

## About

**Get an education that prepares you for the future**

We offer a well-balanced programme with courses that give you both theoretical knowledge and practical tools to analyze quantitative data that equip you well for the future – whether you will work in policy, academia, or in private industries.

The main track gives you a solid ground in both economic theory and quantative methods such as econometrics and data analysis. The programme also offers much flexibility if you instead want to tailor your education to your special interests. Apart from our elective courses in economics, you may take courses in finance or choose from the large variety of courses offered by Graduate School. A specific opportunity is that you will have the option to do an internship within the programme as well as obtain a Double Degree through this programme. .

**Actively engaged teachers**

Many of our teachers are internationally renowned researchers. The Economics department is ranked among the top 100 in the world and number 2 in Sweden in terms of research according to The Tilburg University Top 100 Worldwide Economics Schools Research Ranking. This ensures that our programme corresponds to state-of-the-art research. Additionally, many of our teachers also have engagement outside of the university: they e.g., advise multinational pharmaceutical companies on pricing, serve as competition law judges or work with the World Bank. Such experiences guarantee that their teaching is also practically relevant.

**International Environment**

Economics is an international field, and with that comes an international job market once you have your degree. In our programme, you will meet students and teachers from all over the world, and may gain even more international experience by choosing to go abroad for an exchange semester at any of our many partner universities. A special opportunity is our Double Degree agreements. If you do a Double Degree, you will study one year in Gothenburg and one year abroad, receiving a full degree from each university. More programme specific information about possibilities to study abroad can be found under Exchange opportunities.

## Programme structure and content

**The first semester** covers the fundamentals of economic analysis and

consists of mandatory core courses in Math, Econometrics, and Micro- and Maceoeconomics. **During the second and third semesters** **,** most courses are elective. Our large variety of elective courses provides an opportunity to tailor your education to your particular interest, for example focusing on core economic questions or gaining expertise in sustainability issues. We offer both research-oriented courses and more practice-oriented ones. You can also choose to do an internship with a firm or organization.

**The fourth semester** is dedicated to your master´s thesis, where you apply your acquired skills to analyze relevant economic questions and have the opportunity to reflect the specialization you built throughout previous semesters.

## Who should apply?

- Are you concerned with sustainability and interested in how economics can help us face future sustainability challenges?
- Do you want to find real solutions to important problems rather than relying on quick fixes?
- Are you curious, analytical, and hardworking and want to be challenged to further develop your skillset in economics?

Then our master’s programme in Economics will suit you perfectly!

## Internship

**Internship opportunities**

As one of few programmes, we offer the opportunity to do an internship for ten weeks as part of the education. An internship can build a bridge between the academic courses and working life and is much appreciated among our students. You could do an internship with a firm, a public authority or other organization or, you may be a research assistant at the economics department, where you will be practically involved in some research project. In either case, you will make use of your knowledge gained during the courses and apply it more hands-on and perhaps get the chance to write your master thesis and even get a job after your studies.
