## Summary

Our programme equips you with skills needed to work with entrepreneurship by providing you with scientific and practical knowledge to enhance your entrepreneurial ability and increase your knowledge of how to identify, capture, and create value for industry and society. We do so through a uniquely curated portfolio of courses explaining the theoretical underpinnings of innovation and its links and importance for entrepreneurship, combined with more practice-oriented courses where you in real life settings work with entrepreneurial ideas.

## About

When we hear the word entrepreneurship, we often directly think about the entrepreneur in the sense of individuals who realise different types of ideas into actual businesses. In the master’s programme in Knowledge-based entrepreneurship we widen this lens to focus, not only on the business-making as such, but also the surrounding players and institutions that make these businesses come to life and sustain, namely the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Based on this notion, we educate future entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, and professionals working with entrepreneurship, who all possess strong analytical and creative abilities and the experience to handle complex knowledge areas and markets.

### An integrative, international, and interactive approach

A core underpinning for entrepreneurship is the ability to source multiple forms of knowledge and talent to jointly work towards a final goal. During your studies, we therefore challenge you by combining theoretical development with continuous teamwork where skills in collaboration and project leadership are practiced. Your fellow students will have varied backgrounds, both in terms of mix of nationalities, as well as previous academic degrees and work experience. This provides first-hand experience of how different perspectives and competencies complement each other in complex real-life business situations, giving you a more profound understanding for the skills and tools needed in your profession. As such, we prepare you for a career working with entrepreneurship in a wider sense, be it as a future business owner or as a valuable asset for other individuals testing out their ideas, all as part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

### Hands-on learning

During your education, you will meet faculty specialised in various aspects of entrepreneurship through their research, as well as interact and work with professionals from the local entrepreneurial ecosystem. We provide a full venture-creation process, where you develop project-leader skills in a creative incubation environment with support and resources from the University of Gothenburg’s own venture support, GU Ventures. As part of this, you also have the opportunity to apply for bringing your own ideas into your educational journey as part of the course offerings.

Entrepreneurship requires confidence to cope with change and uncertainties, and our learning outcomes are designed to help you acquire the perspectives, skills, and experiences necessary to take on an entrepreneurial role in the future. From day one, you will be involved in developing ideas and live projects, but also improving business models for existing start-ups.

### Personal development and business development

Profound learning of innovation and entrepreneurship comes with a combination of theoretically driven knowledge, a versatile toolbox, exposure to good practice, and hands-on experience. An important part of the programme is developing your own personal and professional skills, which are crucial to driving entrepreneurship successfully. We focus on your strengths and behavioural styles and how they can be used in multidisciplinary teams, providing you with approaches to handle and mitigate conflicts in groups and develop high-performing teams. You will acquire strategies to negotiate deals, handle resistance towards new ideas, and successfully present and pitch your ideas. We emphasize preparing you for your future career path.

## Programme structure and content

The programme offers a combination of courses for theoretical development and understanding combined with practical application. You will gain a thorough theoretical understanding of entrepreneurship as a concept and how it is linked to its surrounding ecosystem. This includes courses tied to areas such as knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship, risk management, and innovation and structural transformation. More specified applications of entrepreneurship will be covered in courses related to social innovation as well as sustainability aspects.

Throughout the programme, you will also have a series of courses focused on the practical application of the knowledge developed. These courses offer you insights on the development of entrepreneurial ventures, from idea generation to scaling. As part of this process, you will work with external idea providers, and will also be offered the opportunity to pitch your own ideas for inclusion in your course work.

Students enrolled in the programme have the possibility of applying for exchange studies at one of the School’s partner universities.

### Selection

Applicants who meet the entrance requirements (general and programme specific) are divided into two groups. First, all places are allocated to applicants in group 1. If any places are left they are distributed to applicants in group 2.

**Group 1 (prioritized)**

Group 1 is applicants with a GMAT score. Applicants are ranked by their GMAT score result. For further information: [minimum accepted GMAT score, last day to write test etc.](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat "https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat")

It is not mandatory to submit a GMAT score, but having a GMAT score that reaches the minimum will give you priority in the admission. Applicants with test results that do not meet the minimum are placed in selection group 2.

**Group 2 (secondary)**

Group 2 is applicants ranked by number of university credits (ECTS credits). Applicants are ranked by number of credits reported on the last day for application (max. 165 ECTS credits).

If several applicants have the same number of credits the selection of students is made by ballot.
