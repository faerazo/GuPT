## Summary

The program provides students with an in-depth understanding of how AI is transforming society and gives them the skills necessary to take leading roles in that transformation. Through a close relationship with innovative multidisciplinary research, the program offers students a broad theoretical foundation for analyzing the implications of AI and through close connections to industry, the public sector, and civil society, the program offers students practical skills for managing AI-driven change in complex environments.

## About

Artificial Intelligence creates radically new conditions for both individuals and society at large. It brings completely new possibilities but also new challenges where existing ways of working, understanding, and communicating are fundamentally changed.

Making sense of these possibilities and challenges is crucial to ensuring that the development and implementation of AI can be shaped in ways that are sustainable and can contribute to solving rather than worsening global societal challenges.

### A human outlook on AI

In the program, students learn to take a human-centered approach that brings the individual and social aspects of human-AI interactions into focus so that AI can be implemented responsibly. This involves considering individual, interactional, organizational, social, and ethical aspects of the use of a particular AI solution in a particular context whether that be a decision process at a government agency, diagnosis support at a hospital, film recommendations online, or grading of exams at school.

### A multidisciplinary area

The program offers a unique environment for future UX designers, developers, researchers, business developers, policy analysts, and compliance officers looking to specialize in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.

As the field of HCAI is multidisciplinary, students come into contact and engage with leading researchers across several subject areas including Human-computer Interaction, Information Systems, Cognition Science, Applied IT, and Data Science.

The pedagogical approach taken encourages active participation where students are expected to engage in discussion and hands-on activities while documenting their progression through a portfolio of work that shows both their learning in the field of HCAI and the development of their own interests. These interests can then be further explored through a research-based thesis and the opportunity to undertake an internship within a research group or at a company or organization.

The program is found at the vibrant Campus Lindholmen, a technological hub with a large industry presence including such companies and organizations as Zenseact, RISE, Ericsson, and Volvo, to name a few.

## Who should apply?

The HCAI program strives for a diverse student group and welcomes students with a bachelor's degree from different fields including cognitive science, information systems, and interaction design.

Applications are welcome from those with degrees in other areas if all required prerequisites are met. These prerequisites include 7.5 credits of programming in a general programming language, 7.5 credits in artificial intelligence or machine learning, and 7.5 credits in human-computer or human-technology interaction.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor's degree 180 credits including an independent project (degree project) of at least 15 credits or equivalent.

7\\.5 credits programming in a general programming language, 7.5 credits in artificial intelligence or machine learning, and 7.5 credits in human-computer interaction or human-technology interaction.

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

As a multidisciplinary master the program offers students the opportunity to specialize in HCAI as a complement to their existing educational and professional background. It prepares students for a wide variety of professional roles such as UX designers, developers, researchers, business developers, policy analysts, and compliance officers, each an area where specialized knowledge of HCAI is increasingly important as AI systems are integrated into the fabric of society.

For those who aim to continue their education beyond the master’s level, the program also prepares students for doctoral studies.

## Facilities

The master's programme is given by the Department of Applied Information Technology, which is located in the middle of Sweden's leading technology hub, Lindholmen Science Park close to the city center in Gothenburg.

## Exchange opportunities

During year two of the master's programme there are elective courses equivalent to 30 credits. As a student you have the opportunity to apply for exchange studies in Europe or in other parts of the world. Former students from our master's programmes have gained valuable experience when they have studied at our partner universities in, for example, Paris, Japan and Singapore. As an exchange student, you do not need to pay any semester fees and since the study abroad is credited in your degree, no extra study time is added to your education.
