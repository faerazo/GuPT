## Summary

The master’s programme in International Business and Trade provides a distinctive combination of training and knowledge about the functioning of multinational companies—large and small—in the global economy. As a student of the programme, you will enhance your understanding of the geography, processes, and organization of international business and develop capabilities for sustainable and competitive managerial decision making.

## About

Continuous globalization processes of domestic economies have led to a

situation where firms must face and comprehend the impact of global

production, innovation, and trade networks. Consequently, there is a

growing need for firms and managers to respond to increased

opportunities and complexities of greater and more relaxed movement of

capital, people, services, products, and knowledge as they are subject

to, and must understand, stakeholders at national and supranational

levels. This programme offers a unique cross-disciplinary outlook on

global business—international business and economic geography.

## Programme structure and content

The programme contains eight core courses that provide in-depth knowledge about the following topics, among others:

- international business environment analysis
- the internationalization of small- and medium-sized firms
- international strategic management
- the globalization of innovation
- international business in Asian emerging markets
- managing and organizing multinational corporations
- research methods

You may choose four elective courses, some of which may be exchange study

courses. The elective courses can, for example, be within management,

marketing, innovation, finance, and logistics, and may vary from year to

year.

The final semester is devoted to your master’s thesis,

which is usually written in pairs. We particularly encourage you to

carry out your thesis work in close contact with multinational

corporations or international organizations.

## Who should apply?

- Do you believe that skills to successfully make sustainable and


competitive managerial decisions on a global arena are important?

If you have a global outlook on your future career, then apply for the master’s programme in International Business and Trade.

### Selection

Applicants who meet the entrance requirements (general and programme specific) are divided into two groups. First, all places are allocated to applicants in group 1. If any places are left they are distributed to applicants in group 2.

**Group 1 (prioritized)**

Group 1 is applicants with a GMAT score. Applicants are ranked by their GMAT score result. For further information: [minimum accepted GMAT score, last day to write test etc.](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat "https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat")

It is not mandatory to submit a GMAT score, but having a GMAT score that reaches the minimum will give you priority in the admission. Applicants with test results that do not meet the minimum are placed in selection group 2.

**Group 2 (secondary)**

Group 2 is applicants ranked by number of university credits (ECTS credits). Applicants are ranked by number of credits reported on the last day for application (max. 165 ECTS credits).

If several applicants have the same number of credits the selection of students is made by ballot.
