## Summary

Design can shape fair and habitable futures. With a strong emphasis on artistic research and practice, the MFA Design programme positions design within an expanded field of culture, ecology, and politics. Rather than focusing on a specific medium, this programme encourages you to address pressing issues by exploring how design can contribute to a range of disciplines and practices across the arts, sciences, and humanities. Studies are driven by your individual interests and specialisations, fostering diverse approaches to design.

## About

This two-year master’s programme is designed to redefine the role of the designer within complex social, political, and ecological structures. It encourages you to develop design practices that can contribute to social justice, ecological resilience, and long-term habitability. Instead of focusing solely on traditional design outputs, the programme offers a broad, practice-based approach that intersects with other knowledge fields to explore how design can shape fair and sustainable futures. The curriculum addresses critical themes such as built and unbuilt environments, labour, spatial justice, and heritage, with a focus on how design can mediate conditions and possibilities in both local and global contexts.

### An Expanded Design Approach

At the core of the programme is the understanding that design shapes our daily lives. Design is taught as an expanded field of practice that not only addresses artistic and material concerns but also contributes to critical social and political discourses. Through practice and research, you are encouraged to engage with the surrounding world, and through relational design seek ways to design for sustainable life together.

### Commitment to a Diverse and Sustainable Future

At its core, the programme draws from Scandinavian traditions of democracy, participation, and social welfare. You will engage in practical projects that investigate challenging ideas on how designers can position themselves to work towards liveable futures. The international student body and faculty bring diverse perspectives, creating a rich environment for exploring a variety of cultural, ecological, and political issues.

This programme is a part of [GU’s Sustainability-Focused programmes.](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/study-options/sustainability-labelled-programmes)

Get to know teachers and other staff at [the Design Unit.](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff?organisation=The%20Design%20Unit&q=%2A)

## Programme structure and content

In the first year, you are introduced to relational and situated design practices, which form the foundation for developing design questions and articulating material responses. Through a combination of practical and theoretical work, you explore how designers can act as agents of social change. First-year courses include:

• Relational Practice

• Design Studies

• Social Transformation

• Elective course (based on an annual course offering)

The second year focuses on the master's thesis project. You will deepen your engagement with the chosen design questions and develop advanced knowledge in their area of specialization. The thesis encourages you to create not just individual artefacts or designs, but entire areas of practice and research that enable you to engage with various professional contexts. Second-year courses include:

• Master’s Degree Project in Design 1

• Master’s Degree Project in Design 2

## Who should apply?

- Are you passionate about using design to address urgent ecological and social issues?

- Do you see design as a way to engage with political and environmental challenges?

- Are you eager to explore how design can create fair and habitable futures?

- Do you want to develop your artistic practice in a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment?


If these questions resonate with you, and if you are ready to challenge the boundaries of design to make a tangible impact on society, then the master’s programme in Design is for you.
