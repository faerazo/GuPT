## Summary

The master’s programme in Applied Arts and Design challenges how you perceive materials and space with two specializations: metal art and wood-oriented furniture design. You will develop critical perspectives in relation to society and current debates while pursuing your own projects. As a student specializing in metal art, you will engage in a hands-on, explorative approach through material and process, and are encouraged to reflect on your future role as an artist in the public, private, or gallery realm.

## About

We build upon a long tradition of metal art in society by encouraging you to elaborate and develop what a studio practice in metal means today. By developing a personal language with the material though traditional processes—such as blacksmithing, and casting—and new fabrication techniques, you will be challenged to consider the relevance of contemporary metal art and your place within it. Our programme offers you the opportunity to develop relationships with professionals in the field network building and tutoring.

### Material-led, hands-on learning in a unique environment

In the unique academic environment in Dals Långed, 170 kilometres north of Gothenburg, you will have access to some of Europe’s most well-equipped workshops, sketch areas, computers, and software, empowering you to work wholeheartedly within your field. We have a long history of engagement in global and local society, with education in craft and design existing at our location since around 1930. Our programme is interdisciplinary and incorporates art, crafts, and design. Though you will focus on metal art, you will work in a mutually beneficial learning environment with students of wood-oriented furniture design and textile-body-space, all pursuing various methods of working.

### An entrepreneurial approach

Our programme offers freedom to pursue projects formulated from your own ideas and requires a high degree of personal motivation, with tutoring to support you. You will learn to relate to materials, body, and space through your material-based creative work, critical perspectives, and societal engagement, training you to move easily between practice and theory. We encourage you to develop your own style and voice and pursue your interests and goals for your future practice. Our highly international group works in close collaboration with the surrounding local community. This network allows mutually beneficial critiquing and an encouraging environment for solving problems. You will formulate your projects along with your professor in relevance to your course work and specialization.

### Specializing in metal art

The 1,200 square metre space is the largest academic metal workshop in the world—offers enormous possibilities for multifaceted, three-dimensional work, fabrication, and experimental metal work. Our facilities—including several coal-fired forges, power hammers, presses, and tools for cutting, welding, small bronze casting, and working with sheet metal—offer everything you need to realize your ideas. Our students are often recognized for pushing the boundaries of the craft in international exhibitions, publications, symposia, and awards. Additionally, we collaborate closely with other academic programmes in the field, such as Carbondale, Hereford, Hildesheim, and Tallinn, and have an active exchange of students and teachers.

## Programme structure and content

The programme is project based and requires a high degree of autonomy, independence, and self-motivation. Projects are formulated together with your professor and supported by individual tutoring, theory, and seminars.

During the first year, you will familiarize yourself with the workshops and machinery and begin your studio project. You will gain a basic understanding of research and entrepreneurship, expand your subject knowledge, formulate an action plan for your future practice, and build up your portfolio with projects.

The second year relates contemporary issues to your own work. You will write a background text and reflect on the context and form of presentation of your degree project. An external mentor will assist you during your degree project, and examinations include external opponents. The spring term ends with a degree exhibition.

## Who should apply?

Are you interested in exploring the many possibilities and intellectual meaning of metal as an artistic material?

Do you want to pursue experimental, material-based work and investigate contemporary art and craft though metal art and blacksmithing?

Are you passionate about your work and want to be recognized in the professional field for pushing the craft forward?

If you want to hone your craftmanship and develop your role as an artist and practitioner, then apply for the master’s programme in Applied Arts and Design specializing in metal art.
