## Summary

The Master’s Programme in Strategic Human Resource Management and Labour Relations is offered to international and Swedish students and provides knowledge about working life and especially work within Strategic Human Resource Management (HRM). The Master’s Programme has an international approach, addresses both international and Swedish students and is offered jointly by the Department of Business Administration and the Department of Sociology and Work Science.

## About

Current research

The Master´s Programme connects with current research in the field and relates to topics such as social change, globalisation, the establishment of employment and company staffing, new forms of employment, recruitment and the reorganisation of HR functions, to mention a few. Students also receive crucial training in scientific work, both through courses in scientific method and theory that prepare them for their own independent study project i.e. the Master´s thesis.

The research- and teaching team is interdisciplinary and involve researchers from a number of fields, such as Business Administration, Sociology and Work Science.

### Pedagogical ideas and methods

This Master´s Programme departs from the pedagogical approach of student-centered learning, which means that the programme promotes learning activities that enable students to gain new knowledge through active participation.

In addition to more traditional lectures and seminars, learning activities include compulsory group work where the results of the group's work are presented both in writing and orally. Group work requires collegiality, active participation and assuming responsibility as well as producing independent academic texts.

### Learning outcomes

The goal of this Master is to develop the students' ability to translate goals into strategies and activities, and provide the latest research, practice and methods in HRM.

### Degree

Master of Science (120 credits) with a major in Strategic Human Resource Management and Labour Relations.

Key features of the Programme include:

- Close links with current research within the Department of Sociology and Work Science
- Comprehensive courses in both qualitative and quantitative research methods
- Possibility to study abroad or take a work placement
- Extensive individual supervision during the completion of a 30 credits Master's Thesis
