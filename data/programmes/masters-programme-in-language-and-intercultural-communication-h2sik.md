## Summary

This programme combines high-level skills in languages with intercultural communication and gives the student access to a broad labour market. The programme starts each autumn semester.

The main fields of study are African languages, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish.

## About

### Interpreting and understanding

Mobility and migration are growing elements of our society today, and it is therefore becoming important to be able to detect and respond to a variety of linguistic and cultural phenomena, to be able to interact with people from a variety of backgrounds, and to handle issues, contradictions and frictions that may arise, which can have linguistic and cultural causes.

Studies within the Master’s programme in Language and Intercultural Communication give you the linguistic tools you need to explore, interpret and understand a range of linguistic and cultural expressions and to draw conclusions about how discourses on culture and cultural differences can influence communication between and about different cultures. This capacity to analyse and discuss communicative manifestations of culture gives you a global education in languages and a cultural competence that is extremely useful for working in international milieus and handling intercultural encounters and opportunities.

You do not need to have studied languages at university level in the

past, but you must have good reading and writing skills in the language

that you choose to take your degree in. Read more about the language

requirements under Prerequisites.

### Apply for scholarship
