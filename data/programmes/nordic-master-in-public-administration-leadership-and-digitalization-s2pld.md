## Summary

The Nordic master programme in public administration, leadership, and digitalization is a research-based programme for the next generation of academics and practitioners. The programme will prepare you with theoretical understandings and practical know-how of how control and organization within the public sector is exercised in a distinct Nordic perspective.

## About

The Nordic master program in public administration, leadership and digitalisation is a two-year master's program (120 credits), which is given in collaboration between the University of Gothenburg, NORD University in Bodø and Åbo Akademi University.

The program focuses on how the public sector in the Nordic region and globally is affected and transformed by ongoing digitalization processes. The program is to a large extent based on the Nordic experience of governance and management models observed in Sweden, Norway, and Finland and offers an understanding of national, local, and global traditions, contexts, and cultures and also how these have been affected and developed over time. The program challenges and engages students' critical thinking and assessment of public leadership, with a direct link to economic and political idea traditions.

The program is given at full speed in collaboration between the University of Gothenburg (GU), the NORD University of Bodø in Norway (NORD) and the Åbo Akademy University in Finland (ÅA). The overall structure of the program requires students to participate in at least 30 ECTS at at least two of the collaborative educational institutions within the framework of their two-year master's program. At least one semester (30 ECTS) at the University of Gothenburg is mandatory within the program.

The program is further characterized by a high degree of flexibility. A total of 60 ECTS in the program consist of elective courses (second courses; presented in appendix). Students are given the opportunity, in consultation with the student councillor, to create individual focus areas within the program in order to be able to meet individual wishes, needs, and thoughts on future career goals.
