## Summary

Are you interested in the contemporary global challenges we face? Do you seek deeper knowledge on issues such as war, global inequality, and environmental change? In the Bachelor's Programme in International Relations, you learn about international structures and interactions, and gain skills to analyse, investigate and evaluate issues related to key global challenges.

## About

International and global contexts, processes and institutions play a more important role in working life as a whole and our everyday lives. In a globalized world, international relations are complex and shifting, and the demand for professionals with knowledge of global issues and competence to analyse international events have increased.

The Bachelor's Programme in International Relations gives you skills to analyse, investigate and evaluate issues related to international conflict and cooperation. You will explore different theoretical perspectives and how they bring varied understandings and analyses of our world.

The programme gives you specific knowledge on:

- war, conflict and security;
- peacebuilding;
- global political economy;
- interventions in order to end armed conflict;
- migration and sustainability;
- structure of the international system;
- complex and shifting power relations;
- multilateral organizations, global governance and world regions;
- political theory originating in different schools of thought as well as in different world regions;
- diplomacy and international negotiation;
- and the impact of climate change and new technologies on international relations.

### Gender equality perspective

The programme has a focus on gender equality issues related to international relations, and different perspectives on gender and gender equality will play a role in all courses.

### Sustainability and international relations

The critical approaches and reflective perspectives of the programme contribute to the ability to better address difficult and socially controversial issues regarding how sustainability issues should be handled. At the programme, you get in-depth knowledge on peaceful and inclusive societies, the connection between all the goals in the Sustainable Development Agenda, and the connection between climate change, social vulnerability and conflict. Through knowledge of the international system and how multilateral cooperation works, you are provided with tools to understand and manage sustainability issues in practice.

## Programme structure and content

The introductory and in-depth courses during the first year provide you with different theories and perspectives on international relations as well as knowledge on pressing global issues. You learn about the global political economy and how war and security affect international relations and what tools the international system has to manage and end international armed conflicts.

During your second year, you develop a deeper understanding through advanced courses and attend proficiency courses to prepare you for the labour market.

During the third year's autumn semester, you apply to optional courses of your choice, or apply for exchange studies. The spring semester offers unique courses on foreign policy and diplomacy and in international conflict resolution. You complete your studies in the programme by writing your thesis guided by a supervisor.

Current research is given space in the program, and the programme balances traditional concepts with the latest research findings and perspectives, especially from the global south.

## Who should apply?

Apply for the Bachelor’s Programme in International Relations if you are interested in global challenges, equality, justice and sustainability issues, if you seek deeper knowledge concerning shifting power relations in the international system, and if want to develop skills to analyse issues related to international conflicts and peacebuilding.

## Facilities

Teaching at the School of Global Studies is held at Annedalsseminariet in central Gothenburg. Our facilities are well-equipped with learning technology and we offer teaching in gallery-seated lecture halls and smaller rooms for seminars or group sessions.

Annedalsseminariet is accessible with an elevator, orientation signs in Braille, a ramp at the entrance door, accessible WC, and automatic door openers. Tram and bus stops are nearby.

## Exchange opportunities

While studying the Bachelor’s Programme in International Relations you can apply for exchange studies during the fall semester in the third year. If exchange studies are granted, you will get international experience while also growing as a person, and making yourself more attractive on the job market. Additionally, you will make new friends that also will be great contacts in the future. You will be sure to return to Gothenburg with renewed energy.

As an exchange student you study part of the programme at a university abroad that the University of Gothenburg has an exchange agreement with. You don’t have to pay extra tuition fees at the exchange university and you can apply for grants. If you are entitled to study finance support from CSN you will retain it while on exchange.
