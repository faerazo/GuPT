## Summary

The master’s programme in Gendering Practices develops your critical perspectives and advances your knowledge about power relations, equality work, and social and cultural norms. Drawing on the strength of the interdisciplinary field of gender studies, the programme collaborates with scholars working with gender and feminist theory at other departments. As a student of the programme, you will enhance your practical work with theories of power relations and equality work and will gain methodological insights into the field of gender studies.

## About

Do you want to change the world? Do you want to challenge social and cultural norms about gender, ethnicity, sexuality, class, age and functionality? Are you interested in working with issues of gender and equality in your everyday practice? If you have a background or interest in feminist theory and want to be a positive change in society, then apply for the master’s programme in Gendering Practices.

This programme will help you develop a reflexive approach to your practical work, and provide you with methodological insights into the field of Gender Studies and research. The programme is structured around the conviction that gender studies is an interdisciplinary field, and that theory and practice are intertwined.

Collective and reflexive work is important in the programme. The

teaching comprises of collaborative work, creative and reflexive writing

exercises, reading groups, workshops,

lectures and student led seminars. The programme offers also eight weeks

of internship.

Gendering Practices will prepare you for an international labour market that requires advanced knowledges about – and critical perspectives on – power relations, equality work, and social and cultural norms.

## Programme structure and content

The first semester consists of two core courses: Theoretical Perspectives in Gender Studies and Methodologies in Gender Studies.

During the second semester, you achieve deeper knowledge with one core course and one elective course. During the second half of the second semester, you can also choose to take the programme specific course, Independent Explorations in a field of Gender Studies, in order to deepen your knowledge within a specific field. You can choose between a number of courses where you are guaranteed a place. Talk to your study counselor or coordinator for more information. You may also take courses at other departments at GU or other Universities in Sweden.

The first part of the third semester consists of an eight-week Internship. The internship can also take place during the second half of the semester to accommodate for additional courses.

On the fourth semester you will complete your master’s thesis.
