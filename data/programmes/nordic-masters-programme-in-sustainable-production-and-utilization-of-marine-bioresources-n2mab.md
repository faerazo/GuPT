## Summary

This Nordic master’s programme offers a deep and coherent integration of biological, environmental, social, legal, and spatial planning aspects of sustainable production and utilization of marine bioresources collaboratively by three Nordic universities. As a student of the programme, you will develop knowledge and skills in marine food production systems and build networks and partnership opportunities with academic institutions, the industry, authorities and the seafood trade, and product and marketing institutions.

## About

### About

The Earth’s population is growing. One of the greatest challenges of our time is to find solutions for increased production of healthy food, while at the same time reducing our ecological footprint and protecting natural resources and ecosystems and advancing rural development. Oceans and coastal waters—but also lakes and streams—provide amazing resources that must be managed sustainably. Knowledge of modern transdisciplinary methods to implement the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations conventions on ecosystems approach to aquaculture and responsible fisheries are essential for future ocean professionals.

### Crossing borders

The programme is collaboratively offered by three Nordic Universities: The University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Nord University, Bodø, Norway; Hólar University, Iceland. Your mobility as student is facilitated and we combine the research and competences of the partner universities in order to educate a generation of broad-thinking professionals within the area of marine circular economy and utilization of marine bioresources. Many employers within the area of production and utilization of marine bioresources require international collaboration, therefore the mandatory mobility between the three Nordic universities and ample possibilities for other mobility is a valuable qualification for future employment.

[About the Erasmus+ exchange programme on the Student Portal](https://studentportal.gu.se/english/Abroad/grants_for_exchange_studies/erasmus-)

### Create a unique profile

In the beginning of the programme, you will meet researchers, teachers, and representatives from the industry and other stakeholders. Individual study plans will be set up during the mandatory course to support your unique course choices, according to your interests and the course prerequisites. Individual study plans crossing over between natural sciences and social sciences are encouraged, but you are also welcomed to focus in on either natural or the social sciences. At least 30 credits must be completed at a partner university other than the one you registered with, ensuring that you meet the mobility requirement (and benefit!) of the programme. Finally, there are altogether more than 50 courses offered as electives that you can choose from, with at least 10 offered by each university.

- Contact Study Counsellors: [info\_mar-bio@swemarc.gu.se](mailto:info_mar-bio@swemarc.gu.se )

### Preparing you for the future

Our programme targets inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to the interactions between aquaculture, fisheries, and production and utilization of marine bioresources. We address the entire value chain “from ocean to table” and also including development and entrepreneurship.

This will prepare you for a wide array of job opportunities—as a doctoral student or in industry—within the area of marine circular economy and blue growth. The three partner universities have extended networks with relevant stakeholders in the private sector, management authorities, and higher education worldwide, and as a student, you will be able to broaden your network within this area.

## Programme structure and content

The programme begins with one mandatory course (15 credits) that is internet based in combination with sections where all students gather at three Nordic partner universities—one week at each—for intensive campus parts. For the remainder of the first year, you are free to choose between more than 50 courses offered by the partner universities.

At least 30 credits must be obtained at one of the Nordic universities within the programme other than the University of Gothenburg. The second year is dedicated to your individual degree project. The courses occur at various times in the academic year and there are at least 10 recommended courses from each University.

The 30 credits that need to be obtained from one of the partner universities, can be applied for during the semester before the planned mobility. At all three partner universities you can apply for the Erasmus+ exchange studies programme.

## Who should apply?

Do you want to help solve the major global challenge of finding solutions for increased production of healthy food to meet the needs of a growing world population?

Are you one of the next generation professionals who will help to reduce our ecological footprint, protecting natural resources and ecosystems and advancing rural development?

Do you want a career within the area of sustainable marine circular economy?

If so, you should apply for our Nordic master’s programme in Sustainable Production and Utilization of Marine Bioresources.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor's degree (180 credits) in natural science, social science and arts. English B/English 6 or equivalent. Students with equivalent education may, after supplementary examination, be admitted to the program. Admission to the masters's programme will be possible through any of the four partner Universities offering this Nordic Master programme in Sustainable production and utilisation of marine bioresources.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates shall be awarded master’s degrees from at least two of the Consortium Universities where they have been admitted. Each university you apply to will issue a degree certificate, including a diploma supplement. The University of Gothenburg awards the degree Master of Science with a major in Sustainable Production and Utilization of Marine Bioresources.

You will be prepared for a wide array of job opportunities, within the industry, at authorities or as a PhD student, within the area of circular bioeconomy and blue growth.

## Facilities

The introductory course is a web-based course that includes physical meetings at each of the participating universities. For the rest of the courses teaching is based at the university which is responsible for the course. The courses given at the university of Gothenburg will be taught at Natrium (Medicinaregatan 7B). Part of the teaching takes place at our marine field stations Tjärnö outside Strömstad and at Kristineberg outside Fiskebäckskil.

Teaching at our field stations may involve a cost for you as a student.

## Exchange opportunities

A requirement for the Nordic Master”s program (MAR-BIO) is a mobility of at least 30 ECTs for all students. This will be fulfilled by course work at one or more of the partner universities that is not the university where the students registered to the program. This exchange will be facilitated by a possibility to apply for Erasmus+ exchange.
