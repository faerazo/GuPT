In every society, craft provide vital reference points, helping us shape the future while grounding us in the present. Craft link human needs and activities across history creating a dynamic artistic field that engages with both cultural heritage and contemporary practice. At HDK-Valand, the master’s programme in Craft forms part of a vibrant academic environment where undergraduate education, research, and societal engagement are constantly in dialogue.

### **The master’s programme in Craft offers three specialisations:**

Each specialisation provides a unique opportunity to delve into artistic exploration and conceptual development through materials. The programme is designed to cultivate your ability to initiate and realise artistic projects, encouraging independent thinking, critical analysis, and technical mastery.

### Collaborative Work Environment and Individual Development

The small study groups and close contact with experienced teachers create an environment that fosters collaboration and intensive learning. This setting allows you to develop confidence in your working methods, broaden your artistic perspective, and enhance both technical and theoretical knowledge. Each student is provided with an individual workspace and generous access to our state-of-the-art facilities.

### Shaping Your Artistic Expression

Through studio work, lectures, seminars, and supervision, you will shape your artistic expression and engage deeply with materials and concepts. The programme encourages the development of skill-based knowledge, fosters debate about material inquiries, and investigates the conceptual identity of craft.

### Specialising in Textile Art

Choosing to specialise in textile art at HDK-Valand opens a world of creative possibilities. In the light and beautiful textile workshops—the fibre workshop and the printing workshop—you will find equipment to work with manual and digital techniques for tapestry and jacquard weaving, tufting, sewing, printing, colouring and embroidery, to mention a few. This environment supports your exploration of diverse materials and techniques, encouraging a deep engagement with the artistic process and the development of your unique creative approach.

Our small study groups and close contact with experienced, internationally recognised teachers create an intensive learning environment that fosters collaboration and personal growth.
