## Summary

The master’s programme in Theology offers a well-rounded and advanced education with two specializations: biblical studies and systematic theology. Both specializations include training in core skills in theology and the humanities. If you specialize in systematic theology, you will learn about the main tenets of the Christian doctrinal tradition and the relations between theology, politics, and ethics. You will study in close contact with internationally recognized teachers active in research and leaders in their field.

## About

How faith works globally, the role of faith in politics and public debate, questions of justice, and the nature of our post secular condition are all areas where we equip you to participate with knowledge, skill, and understanding. You will develop an understanding of how you can provide leadership in these politically complex situations. Furthermore, we address the relation between science and religion and explore the deep-rooted system tying them together from the very origins of science. We also delve deep and investigate the 2000-year-old continuous tradition of Christian thought and practice—the theological tradition and its consequences. Our programme is designed to provide you with an advanced and well-rounded understanding of theology. Common to both specializations is the critical investigation of a rich heritage with a view to contemporary concerns.

**Regular contact with teachers in an international learning environment**

We stand out from other theological programmes by providing regular contact with teachers throughout your courses and thesis work. Our teachers are leaders in their fields with international connections and broad experience in research from different parts of the world, such as Stellenbosch, Heidelberg, Cambridge, Princeton, Durham, and St. Andrews. Seminars and active discussions with fellow students and teachers characterize our academic environment. You will also benefit from our exchange programme with the Theological Faculty at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, enriching your education with visiting teachers and South African students. The exchange programme allows us to send one student each term from Sweden to South Africa.

**Create a unique profile for yourself**

We offer a large number of courses, ensuring a well-rounded theological education while also providing space to follow your own particular research interests. The programme includes a mandatory course—Hermeneutics, Theology, and the Uses of the Bible—that students of both specializations take together. You will then choose elective courses, from our recommendations or according to your motivations. You will write your master’s thesis throughout the second year in parallel to course work, allowing you to hone your writing and research skills and produce a more competent thesis. This provides an excellent foundation for further advanced work in theology, such as doctoral work.

_Note regarding course literature: articles and shorter texts are usually provided by the university. Some longer books will be available digitally, but others will have to be bought or borrowed from a library. If students choose to purchase course texts, the total cost may come to approximately €300 per semester. Note that it is important that students obtain course literature in time for each course introduction._

## Programme structure and content

The programme includes a mandatory methods course and a series of elective courses influenced by your specialization. We recommend course packages, but you may supplement with other courses from our large offering.

The second year is dedicated to your master’s thesis, which you develop with support from teachers and fellow students. You will choose your topic in dialogue with a supervisor who has expert knowledge and will guide you through the process. Taking courses and participating in seminars while you write your thesis results in a more competent and research-oriented thesis, which provides a stepping stone into further research, and also for writing and discussing texts at a high level in non-academic careers.

## Who should apply?

- Are you interested in the relations between theology, politics, and ethics?
- Do you want to deepen your knowledge of Christian doctrinal tradition and explore its influence in the contemporary world?
- Are you passionate about questions of faith and meaning and want to explore existential questions as you learn?

If this sounds like you, then apply for the master’s programme in Theology specializing in systematic theology.
