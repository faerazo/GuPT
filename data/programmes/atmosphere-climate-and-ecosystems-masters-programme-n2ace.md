## Summary

The master’s programme in Atmosphere, Climate, and Ecosystems adds resources to the understanding of and solutions for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It provides you with the opportunity to study the complex global system made up of the atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems, and the related global challenges. As a graduate of the programme, you will be prepared to enter society with broad knowledge in natural science and special competence in a specialized field of science, intermixed with global challenges.

## About

The combination of atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems forms the basis of working with all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our programme provides the chance for you to learn how human activities are linked to physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems and how the complexity of global sustainability challenges can be tackled. From the greenhouse effect and the interaction of climate change and ecosystems, to environmental impacts on human health and the deterioration of material including our cultural heritage, understanding the processes occurring in the atmosphere are crucial.

The program consists of four compulsory courses. Then you specialize by choosing from suggested courses within the profile subjects; atmospheric science, climate or ecosystem. You can choose courses from one or more of the three profile subjects.

The programme is part of the Nordic Atmosphere - Biosphere Studies programme, with additional courses at other Nordic universities to choose from. [ABS Webs – ABS Pathfinders to Environmental Education (helsinki.fi)](https://www.atm.helsinki.fi/abs/).

### Programme structure and content

The program begins with four mandatory courses during the first semester:

- Global change - problem, analysis, measures (ES2613), 7,5 HEC
- Climate Change in an Earth System Perspective (GVN460), 7,5 HEC
- Atmospheric Chemistry 1 (KEM171), 7,5 HEC
- Nature based solutions – potentials, pitfalls and goal conflicts, 7,5 HEC

In the second term of the first year, you choose a specialization in either atmospheric science, climatology, or ecosystems. Proposed courses within each specialization are listed below. You can also mix courses from more than profile.

### Atmospheric Science:

- Period 3: Energy and Environment: Processes, Efficiency, and Impacts (ES2417), 15 HEC
- Period 4: Aerosols (KEM720), 15 HEC

### Climatology:

- Period 3, January-February: Climate change history (GVN360), 7,5 HEC
- Period 3, February-March: Advanced Climate Data Analysis (GVN370), 7,5 HEC
- Period 4: Earth Systems, Field Course, 15 HEC

### Ecosystems:

- Period 3: Plant ecophysiology in a global change perspective (BIO506), 15 HEC
- Period 4: Plant ecology in a global change perspective (BIO503), 15 HEC

### Year 2

In the final year, you do your degree project, which comprises 60 higher education credits (alternatively 45 higher education credits degree project + 15 elective higher education credits). The degree project gives you valuable experience in research, regardless of whether you do it within the university or in collaboration with a research-related company. We have good contacts with several such companies in the region.

A year-long research related thesis project, with the combination of atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems will set you apart in the future job market, both in research and environmental authorities. Our links to research-related companies (RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute for example) is beneficial to those pursuing work in the private sector. The majority of our students do an experimental thesis project, addressing a research question closely connected to a real research task of the group or principal investigator acting as supervisor. In most cases, students work as a member of the research groups.

## Who should apply?

Climate and ecosystems are two of the Global Sustainability Goals, and atmosphere is a vital part of several others. Would you like to study their interactions and be better prepared to contribute to a sustainable future?

Would you like to better understand how air quality affects life quality and ecosystems globally, and discuss solutions?

If you want to learn how human activities are linked to physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems, and how the related problems can be mitigated, then apply to the master’s programme in Atmosphere, Climate, and Ecosystems.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor's degree of at least 180 credits including at least 120 credits in natural sciences including at least 15 credits in basic chemistry. In addition, at least 15 credits in chemistry, 30 credits in earth science or 30 credits in biology are required. Eligibility for one of the profile subjects during the spring semester of year 1 requires at least: 30 credits of chemistry for the profile in atmospheric science, 30 credits of earth sciences for the profile in climate and 30 credits of biology for the profile in ecosystems. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English corresponding to English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School. For more information, see English language requirements on Universityadmissions.se.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Science in Atmosphere, Climate, and Ecosystems.

You will be prepared for research or tasks where solid knowledge in atmospheric, climate, and ecosystem science is of concern, such as environmental authorities, research institutes, universities, and start-ups. Typically, after passing this master’s programme, you could initiate an academic career with PhD studies, conduct research on industrial applications at institutes and companies, be an environmental consultant, or an environmental officer at the municipality, regional, or national level.

We maintain a link with many of our graduates, who take part in the alumni seminars arranged for the environmental science students.

## Facilities

Teaching is conducted in the Natrium building, on Medicinareberget in Gothenburg (Medicinaregatan 7B).

## Exchange opportunities

You can choose to study abroad through our exchange agreements with several prominent universities in Europe, but also in countries such as South Korea, China, India, Jamaica, Kenya and Rwanda.

## Internship

You have the possibility to complete an internship within our collaboration network Gothenburg Centre for Sustainable Development, whose task is to create and facilitate cooperation between Chalmers University of Technology, the University of Gothenburg, and authorities and companies in West Sweden, with an aim to generate and practically implement knowledge about sustainable development. Furthermore, you may choose to study abroad through our exchange agreements with universities in China, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Rwanda. We are also prepared to promote thesis projects related to our international students’ home universities where they completed a bachelor’s degree.
