## Summary

The master's programme in Information Technology and Learning addresses the opportunities and challenges emerging information technologies raise for learning. As a student of the programme, you will have the opportunity to work with leading researchers in learning sciences, educational studies, digital communication, and human-computer interaction. Through hands-on seminar activities, you will become a research-driven leader, a learning experience designer, and a critical analyst of learning technologies.

## About

The changing face of digital technologies provides immense new opportunities and simultaneously gives rise to fundamental challenges for both individuals and society. The field of information technology and learning is currently at the center of attention in debates surrounding issues like source criticism and information evaluation, digital competence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and learning analytics.

### Preparing you for diverse opportunities

A core element of the programme is to provide you with opportunities to develop a varied skillset including methods for data collection and analysis, academic and professional writing, and the competence to review and evaluate existing research. These tools will allow you to evaluate the current state of knowledge, think independently and critically, and stay up to date and relevant in the quickly changing field of educational technology and other professional settings. You will be able to use scientific literature to bypass buzzwords and develop research-based solutions.

During your studies you are able—and encouraged—to individualize your studies based your own interests and desired specialization. A strong background in educational sciences and a specialization in your own interests prepares you for a wide variety of professional opportunities.

### A strong research environment balanced with practical application

Through seminars and lectures, teachers and researchers will address current topics in relation to a variety of research projects and activities with strong connections to research and industry. You will have the opportunity to take part in this vibrant research community and engage with researchers in different disciplines and traditions through, for example, the opportunities to intern in a research group and write your thesis within a project.

Learning experience design is not necessarily about building hardware or software, but rather about arranging, adapting, and configuring various existing technologies for learners in various educational settings. Our programme provides experiences in using and adapting technology as well as the conceptual and theoretical tools that are important in developing the skills and identity of an educational designer with an information technology profile.

## Programme structure and content

Through four mandatory courses in the first two semesters, you will gain foundational knowledge in information technology and learning as a field, learn to understand and apply design as a method, examine how digital media and technologies are changing traditional understandings of literacy, and gain a solid understanding of key research methods.

In the third semester, you can choose elective courses offered by our programme, from other departments at the University of Gothenburg, or from another accredited university.

The fourth semester consists of your master’s thesis, which can be a continuation of your internship work if you choose to undertake an internship.

## Who should apply?

- Are you a proactive student willing to find and shape your own career path? Do you have good communication skills in English?
- Do


you want to understand how information technologies impact the ways we


use knowledge and learn in schools, higher education, working life, and


society?
- Do you want to become a leader in the planning, implementation, and analysis of emergent technologies for learning?

Then you should apply for our master's programme in Information Technology and Learning!

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements
