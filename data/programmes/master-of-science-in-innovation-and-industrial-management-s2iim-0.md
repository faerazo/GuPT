## Summary

The master’s programme in Innovation and Industrial Management equips you for a future as a potential manager in organizations operating in an increasingly uncertain and complex world, with rapidly changing technologies and markets. As a student of the programme, you will get an education with a strong focus on personal and professional development, engage in close interaction with industry, and have ample opportunities for exchange studies.

## About

The master’s programme in Innovation and Industrial Management focuses on how to manage organizations in an increasingly uncertain world, with rapidly changing technologies and markets. Modern companies face complex industrial challenges, particularly in adapting to technological, financial, regulatory, and consumer changes that affect their future profitability and competitiveness. These challenges require organizations to analyse both the internal- and external-to-the-firm processes with relation to innovation, industrial dynamics, markets, and investments. Ignoring renewal and innovation poses long-term threats to the survival of every organization.

**Equipping you for the future**

Our programme prepares you for a future career as a potential manager in the modern organization – for which innovating is not an option but a necessity. The courses, projects, and thesis work focus on providing you with the right theories, methods, and tools to analyze both theoretical and practical problems, and to design effective solutions for these problems. All organizations must find the balance between efficiency and innovation, and between short-term profitability and long-term development. As a student of the programme, you will develop the skills and insight to overcome these challenges and understand this balance.

**Engaging education and close interaction with industry**

We provide a highly engaging educational setting in our programme, which includes a range of teaching methods and a mix of individual and group work, along with a pronounced focus on personal and professional development of the student. In several of our courses, we address not only academic but also practical management problems, for example through many types of real business cases. The programme also includes close interaction with the innovation ecosystem in a variety of industries, ranging from guest lectures to group projects, where you will work with and solve practical problems for firms.

**International environment**

The programme’s international atmosphere allows you to experience other cultures, improve your communication skills, and build a global network of friends. This programme also gives you a unique opportunity to apply for a scholarship which enables you to conduct parts of your master’s thesis abroad. As a student of the master’s programme in Innovation and Industrial Management, you will have several opportunities to go abroad for parts of your studies through exchange agreements and through a double degree agreement, which will be further explained in the Exchange opportunities information.

**How to apply?**

Here is a [step-by-step guide](https://www.gu.se/en/study-in-gothenburg/apply/apply-for-masters-programme) on how to apply for MSc Innovation and Industrial Management.

## Programme structure and content

The master’s programme in Innovation and Industrial Management is centred around a set of mandatory core courses, covering topics such as innovation, strategy, and industrial management. In addition, you will have the opportunity to tailor your education to your particular interests by choosing elective courses, for example within entrepreneurship, project management, or sustainability. The programme concludes with writing a master’s thesis, which is conducted individually or in pairs. The thesis project can be done in collaboration with an external partner, such as a company. During your studies, you also have the possibility of applying for exchange studies at one of the School’s partner universities.

### Selection

Applicants who meet the entrance requirements (general and programme specific) are divided into two groups. First, all places are allocated to applicants in group 1. If any places are left they are distributed to applicants in group 2.

**Group 1 (prioritized)**

Group 1 is applicants with a GMAT score. Applicants are ranked by their GMAT score result. For further information: [minimum accepted GMAT score, last day to write test etc.](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat "https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/gmat")

It is not mandatory to submit a GMAT score, but having a GMAT score that reaches the minimum will give you priority in the admission. Applicants with test results that do not meet the minimum are placed in selection group 2.

**Group 2 (secondary)**

Group 2 is applicants ranked by number of university credits (ECTS credits). Applicants are ranked by number of credits reported on the last day for application (max. 165 ECTS credits).

If several applicants have the same number of credits the selection of students is made by ballot.
