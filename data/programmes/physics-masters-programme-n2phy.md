## Summary

The master’s programme in Physics offers a forward-thinking curriculum in theoretical, computational, and experimental physics. Particular emphasis is placed on astronomy, biological physics, high-energy physics, and material science. As a student of the programme, you will develop your critical evaluation and problem-solving abilities, advanced experimental techniques, collaboration and presentation skills, and engineering skills grounded in the fundamental principles of physics.

## About

Understanding the basic laws of physics has been a fascinating problem since the birth of modern science, and physics forms the basis for technological and engineering sciences. New discoveries within physics often have direct applications and lead to the development of new products and technologies. While these forces present both exciting opportunities and unparalleled challenges, the demand for future scientific solutions and rapid technological innovation remains unchanged. If you choose to study physics you will find many new exciting things to investigate. History has shown that each new generation of physicists makes its own great discoveries.

The master’s programme in Physics emphasizes the interaction between experiment and theory, which characterizes the development of modern physics. In short, theory provides models and concepts that can explain and predict experimental observations. Computers allow for numerical computation of the fundamental laws of physics and advanced techniques, such as machine learning. Using advanced instrumentation, both in-house and at large facilities like Onsala Space Observatory, will provide you with in-depth knowledge of material and biological systems, and of distant stars and galaxies.

Our programme will develop your understanding of the fundamental laws of nature and how they are related to the smallest and most fundamental building blocks. Much of the physics and technology that we meet in everyday life falls into the category of condensed matter physics, and there are many exciting areas within physics where you can study the interaction between atoms or molecules and the consequences. There is also strong development in the areas bordering on chemistry and biology. A further concept is that of complex systems, which involves financial and societal systems in addition to physical, chemical, or biological systems.

The core courses of the programme provide you with a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of physics, preparing you for a future driven by knowledge and technology. We offer five specializations to build upon this foundation, and recommend you choose two of the following to focus on: astronomy, biological physics, computational physics, high-energy physics, materials science

Together with Chalmers University of Technology, we offer a strong research environment with several active researchers as course-responsible teachers in the programme. Research activities include: the study of string theory; computational methods to understand the atomic and sub-atomic scale; energy-related materials, such as lithium batteries; materials for specific applications, such as nanoplasmonics; interfaces between biological systems and inorganic structures; and advanced experiments, in which state-of-the-art instruments contribute to an understanding of both the microscopic world and astrophysical phenomena.

## Programme structure and content

The programme begins with three core courses:

•    Learning from Data

•    Quantum Mechanics

•    Experimental Methods in Modern Physics

These are followed by preparation courses, which provide the necessary foundational knowledge for you to take specialized courses. We recommend you focus on two of the following five tracks:

•    astronomy

•    biological physics

•    computational physics

•    high-energy physics

•    materials science

The last semester is dedicated to your master’s thesis, which addresses a clearly defined topic based on your coursework. You can complete your thesis in collaboration with industry, a research institute, an organization, or within academia. You may also choose to complete a full-year thesis with a heavier research focus.

## Who should apply?

Are you interested in the theoretical, computational, and experimental aspects of physics?

Do you want to learn the theories, models, and concepts that help explain and predict experimental observations?

Do you want the skills to use computers and advanced techniques like machine learning for numerical computation of the fundamental laws of physics?

If you have a keen interest in either the theoretical or experimental aspects of frontline physics and astronomy, then apply to the master’s programme in Physics.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

A Bachelor's degree or the equivalence to 180 Swedish credit points (p) or 180 ECTS credits at an accredited university. At least 90 credits physics (including quantum mechanics), 30 credits maths (including linear algebra and analysis), and programming. Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the degree Master of Science with a major in Physics. The training you receive in problem solving and advanced experimental and theoretical techniques is highly valued in both the private and public sector. You will be prepared for industrial research, consulting, teaching and research organizations, or an academic career.
