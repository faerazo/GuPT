The programme is also known as NoCoM, and is a collaboration with the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen and with the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo.

## About

### The Composing Musician

The programme is a collaboration with the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen and the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo. To take advantage of the strengths and distinctive character of these different environments, you will study during the second and third semesters at the two sister schools, while the first and last semesters are spent at the Academy of Music and Drama in Gothenburg. Admission is based partly on an audition and partly on your written formulation of your preferred specialization.

You will work both independently and in groups. We strive to create a complete study environment where you are able to collaborate extensively with both the bachelor’s and the local master’s programmes in improvisation. Ongoing research in the field is also an important aspect. The programme is characterized by openness transcending genre boundaries and a close collaboration with the world music education.

The programme is characterized by an interdisciplinary environment through interaction with fellow students and visiting lecturers, and we have close links to the research environment at the institution, faculty, and University. Our main teachers are [Anders Hagberg](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/andershagberg), [Thomas Markusson](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/thomasmarkusson), [Jonas Simonson](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/jonassimonson) and visiting lecturers [Anders Jormin](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/andersjormin), [Lena Willemark](https://www.gu.se/en/news/tom-eccles-and-lena-willemark-new-honorary-doctors-at-the-faculty-of-fine-applied-and-performing-arts), [Arve Henriksen](https://www.gu.se/en/news/new-honorary-doctor-arve-henriksen).
