## Summary

The Master´s Programme in Sociology provides rigorous, in-depth research training preparing students for both doctoral studies in the social science and a broad range of professional careers in social research beyond the university. All courses are taught in English and students recruited both domestically and from abroad.

## About

Sociology is a vibrant and influential social science today which has expanded beyond its established concerns with class, social conflict and inequality to address a growing diversity of issues stretching from gender, the body and emotions to migration, new social movements and global environmental change.

This two-year programme embraces the enormous variety of contemporary sociological investigations and seeks to combine the enduring insights and methodological rigour of established traditions with the creative force gained from new leaps in the sociological imagination.

The programme encompasses core modules in contemporary sociological theory as well as applied qualitative and quantitative research methods. An emphasis is also placed on choice and flexibility with opportunities to spend a term of study abroad with an Erasmus partner in sociology or to integrate a period of professional work placement into your degree.

Students are able to take advantage of the strong and dynamic research clusters in the Department of Sociology and Work Science and encouraged to visit research seminars to gain inspiration for their choice of thesis topic. Students complete their Master’s thesis under the individual guidance of a supervisor of their choice. Drawing on the considerable outreach of the department, it is also possible to complete a Master’s thesis in applied social analysis in collaboration with an external partner.
