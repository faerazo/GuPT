## Summary

The programme is for artists that want to develop an interdisciplinary practice and examine how they conduct their authorship. The focus for the programme is the artistic process and its relation to artistic and social contexts. You apply with an investigative project that you develop through the entire programme. As a student, you will try new perspectives and challenge your practices through encounters with teachers, fellow students, invited artists and experts from other fields.

## About

### **This programme accepts new students every two years. The next time to apply is  between December 2023 and January 2024** **, with the studies beginning autumn 2024.**

### Genre-crossing and exploratory creative processes

The master’s programme in Contemporary Performative Arts is for those who are interested in genre-crossing expressions and styles for non-traditional venues. A recurring focus is the complexity of working in an investigative project, the public space, and challenges in the relationship between actor and spectator. The main focus is your investigative project that you develop with various perspectives, including performative sound arts, physical and site-specific gestures, films, and public spaces. You will immerse yourself in your own and others’ artistic methods, reflect on the role of the performative arts in a cross-disciplinary context, and place your specific practice in relation to other artistic expressions.

### Interdisciplinary and collaborative

The programme is characterized by an interdisciplinary environment through interaction with fellow students and visiting lecturers, where societal, site-specific, and dramaturgical aspects are central issues. Also included are courses focusing on contemporary dramaturgies, digital tools, site-specific aspects, and public spaces as an arena for artistic expression. The Academy of Music and Drama provides a platform for meetings and collaborations with students in other programmes in both theatrical and musical areas. Teachers and artists who are active nationally and internationally participate in the programme, and we collaborate with other universities, institutions, independent groups, platforms, and performing artists both locally and internationally.

### An in-depth exploration and development of your ideas

Half of the programme consists of your investigative project, with one module per semester dedicated to it. One aspect of the project is working with experimental forms of academic and artistic writing, and you will receive support through individual supervision. Through seminars, workshops, and lab forums, your project is regularly processed in feedback sessions and critique seminars along with fellow students and teachers. This part of the programme has a clear connection with artistic research in the field. Within the framework of this course, you have a great deal of freedom to test new ideas and reflect on your choices.
