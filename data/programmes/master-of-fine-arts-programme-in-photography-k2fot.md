## Summary

The master’s programme in Photography offers a unique opportunity to refine your photographic practice in an interdisciplinary environment. Through critical and inspiring dialogue with peers and teachers, you’ll hone your work in diverse contexts, with opportunities to present it in public venues, school galleries, and publications. You’ll gain access to both analogue and digital resources as well as project spaces.

## About

Photography plays a crucial role in interpreting, questioning, and sometimes driving change in a world of rapid change. The power of photography is both its presence in the everyday and its ability to be scrutinized, analysed, and recontextualized.

### **Balancing theory, practice, and communication**

The programme combines hands-on practice with critical reflection, allowing you to develop your own photographic projects while engaging with theoretical frameworks that challenge and expand your understanding of the medium. You’ll explore the social, aesthetic, and political dimensions of photography, positioning your work in both local and global contexts. You’ll learn how to effectively communicate your artistic vision through exhibitions in student galleries, collaborations with external venues, and the creation of artist books and/or digital publications. The balance between technical skill-building, intellectual inquiry, and professional presentation is a cornerstone of the education.

### Join a Dynamic Research Environment

While you may not work directly on specific research projects, you’ll have the chance to attend research seminars, interact with doctoral students, and gain insight into innovative methods that push the boundaries of photography as an art form. This environment also provides a strong foundation for those considering PhD studies in artistic practice.

All our teachers are active practitioners, and we emphasize collaborations outside the University. Get to know teachers and other staff at [The Film, Photography and Literary Composition Unit](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff?organisation=The%20Film%2C%20Photography%20and%20Literary%20Composition%20Unit&q=%2A)

## Programme structure and content

The core of the programme is your individual photographic project, where you will develop your artistic practice and technical skills as well as your critical and theoretical understanding of your work. In group discussions and one-on-one meetings with teachers, you’ll refine your approach and deepen your understanding of the social and artistic contexts surrounding photography.

In the Publication course, you will learn professional techniques and methods for producing a photographic publication and make a book dummy based on one of your projects.

During the second term, you will participate in an elective course, broadening your knowledge alongside students from other specialisations. Students apply for the elective courses based on an annual course offering.

In the Professional Development course, you will sharpen your ability to present your work to an audience, while also gaining practical experience in project planning and execution.

Following courses in photographic theory, your master’s thesis will be an investigative essay that challenges and expands on your chosen subject.

## Who should apply?

The programme is aimed at graduates in photography, fine art, visual arts or applicants with professional experience in the field of photography and other related fields.

If you are passionate about exploring how photography can illuminate contemporary issues, this programme is for you. Whether you’re interested in creating compelling visual narratives, experimenting with photographic techniques, or examining photography’s role in culture and society, the master’s programme in Photography offers the tools, guidance, and space you need to develop your ideas.
