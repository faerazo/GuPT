## Summary

The programme is intended for those interested in global health, sustainable development and human rights. We provide you with the proficiency needed to work on global health issues, both nationally and internationally. You will learn how to view global health challenges from different perspectives, understand what causes them and design initiatives that make a difference. After receiving your degree, you will have good opportunities for employment and further studies at the third-cycle level.

## About

**Are you interested in global health, development issues and human rights? Do you want to contribute to a sustainable future by combatting global health disparities? Then you should apply for the Master’s Programme in Global Health. We offer an interdisciplinary programme, the opportunity to study with students from around the world and the knowledge you need to address complex health challenges in your future career.**

What are the main health problems in the world, and what can we do about them? What is needed to achieve the Global Sustainable Development Goals and create greater health equity? What impact do political, cultural and social factors have? These are examples of some of the challenges we face today. This requires joint international efforts based on a broad approach and an understanding of how different factors affect global health. We need experts to work on these issues.

The Master’s Programme in Global Health provides you with knowledge of key theories and methods in global health. You will study for two years full-time. The instruction is in English. The programme is interdisciplinary; students will study global health from many perspectives. Together we move among different subject areas, such as public health, health economics and international relations. This will give you a deeper understanding and new perspectives on global health issues that will better prepare you for professional life.

The programme aims to develop your knowledge of the global burden of disease, the globalisation of healthcare and medical services and initiatives to achieve greater health equity. You will learn about epidemiology, biostatistics, health management and health economics. There is a strong emphasis on human rights and how cultural factors affect international initiatives.

We will provide you with the practical skills and tools needed to identify, analyse and develop actions to solve difficult health problems. We offer several optional courses, giving you the opportunity to specialise in subjects that interest you.

### What it is like to study

**Teaching** The programme focuses on critical thinking. As a student, you cannot be taught what the “right” answers are because there is no single solution or approach to global health problems. Instead you are encouraged to reflect and participate in discussions with other students and teachers in the classroom. Together you will bring different perspectives and new approaches from your different academic and professional backgrounds.

You will study at five different parts of the University of Gothenburg.

- Institute of Medicine

- Department of Social Work

- Department of Economics

- Department of Literature, History of Ideas and Religion

- School of Global Studies


You will meet teachers and visiting lecturers from all over the world with backgrounds in a wide range of disciplinary domains.

The programme mixes different types of instruction, such as lectures, group work, practical sessions and computer labs. You will have different types of examinations, such as written homework assignments, home exams, classroom exams and oral presentations in groups. You will have good opportunities to gain practical experience and insight into working life through internships. You will also have the opportunity to write your master’s degree project for a research team or organisation.
