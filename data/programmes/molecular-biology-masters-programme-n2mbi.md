## Summary

In the Master’s Programme in Molecular Biology, you will learn how the cell’s DNA, proteins, and molecules act and interact, and how you can solve major biological problems by changing the cell's function and properties. You can tailor your education to your own interests and ambitions with advanced-level elective courses. At the end of your studies, you will perform an individual laboratory-based project of up to one year in one of our research groups, preparing you for a successful research career in academia, industry, or public authorities.

## About

In the area of molecular biology, new technologies have been developed, making it possible to see what is happening at the cellular and molecular levels. These technologies, together with the genetic maps of a number of different species, give the foundations for the new challenges of molecular biology: to find new proteins, determine how they interact, and establish what mechanisms guide cellular differentiation. Performing research on a number of different species of model organisms will give you knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that regulate important functions inside the living cell, and also of the development of characteristics of different organisms.

### An in-depth and well-rounded education

The Master’s Programme in Molecular Biology will give you the knowledge, skills, and experience to start a scientific career. You will learn about

- cell and molecular biology in the context of human health, evolutionary biology, fundamental research, drug development, bioinformatics, neurobiology, and other fascinating areas.

- the latest research in each course topic, ranging from gene editing techniques to antibiotic resistance and genome-wide analyses, and from forward genetics in model organisms to human physiology, drug discovery, and evolutionary genomics.


At the end of your studies, you will perform an individual laboratory-based project work of up to one year in one of our top research groups.

Teaching contains many elements of active, problem-based learning. You will actively participate in discussions, gaining deeper knowledge and becoming proficient at analysing and thinking scientifically. You will also develop other important transferable skills such as accuracy, analytical thinking, and communication, preparing you to meet challenges in your future career.

### Create a unique scientific profile

The Master’s Programme in Molecular Biology consists of elective courses, allowing you to create a unique scientific profile. You can either deepen your knowledge in your field or broaden your knowledge by adding other natural science subjects to your curriculum. You can also choose to study any other subject taught at the University of Gothenburg, such as economics or leadership. This enables you to create a unique interdisciplinary degree, letting you stand out on the job market. **Please note that** **participation in some courses may be subject to availability.**

### Why study Molecular Biology at the University of Gothenburg?

- Teaching in small groups and in close contact with your instructors
- Problem-based learning and laboratory-intensive courses connected to ongoing research

- The opportunity to tailor your education to your interests and create a unique profile.

### Top 75 worldwide in Life Sciences—Biological Sciences

In the field of Life Sciences—Biological Sciences, the University of Gothenburg ranks amongst the top 3 universities in Sweden and top 75 worldwide in the ShanghaiRanking 2024. Biological sciences include biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysics, cell biology, and microbiology.

### Scholarship - Pioneering Women in STEM

For the 2025 intake, a special scholarship is available exclusively **for women from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam**. The scholarship will be awarded to one admitted student who has good study results in her bachelor’s degree. [Read more about how to apply and what the scholarship covers on Swedish Institute's website](https://si.se/en/apply/scholarships/pioneeringwomeninstem/).

## Programme structure and content

During the **first year**, you choose recommended in-depth courses in biology, such as molecular biology, genetics, molecular microbiology, neurobiology and immunology.

The **second year** consists of an individual laboratory-based degree project, which you can spend the whole year on, or do a shorter project and take extra courses.

Your degree project is either strongly connected to research and supervised by one of the research groups at the university, or performed outside the university, for instance at a medical laboratory or a drug company. It can also be performed at another university in Sweden or abroad. You will have individual guidance to create a personal study plan, including your degree project and theoretical courses.

## Who should apply?

Are you a natural problem solver who is curious to discover new ways of meeting sustainability challenges, from plant breeding to the development of renewable energy sources, from disease control to the production of new medicines?

Are you fascinated by how the living cell functions?

Do you want to work with fundamental research and drug development?

Then apply for the Master’s Programme in Molecular Biology.

Studying molecular biology in Sweden has the added benefit of contributing to a more gender-equal field, with more equitable funding and opportunities for further education and employment.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Admission to the Master's programme in Molecular Biology is open to those who have completed a Bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology or Biology, including at least 60 credits in Biology and 30 credits in Chemistry or the equivalent.

Students with equivalent qualifications may be admitted to the programme on a competitive basis.International applicants must have a Bachelor of Science, including at least 60 credits in Biology and 30 credits in Chemistry or the equivalent. In addition, English is required as described by Universityadmissions.se underEnglish language requirements.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.
