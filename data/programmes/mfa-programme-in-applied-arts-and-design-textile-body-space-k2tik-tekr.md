## About

_**The admission to the specialisation Textile-Body-Space (MFA programme Applied Arts and Design) starting autumn 2024 is cancelled. No new admission is planned.**_

_**At HDK-Valand there are other MFA programmes where you can explore textile as material. You find the programmes** **[here](https://www.gu.se/en/hdk-valand/study-here/masters-programmes-at-hdk-valand )** **. Deadline for applications: 15 January 2024.**_

_**There is an ongoing development of Crafts at HDK-Valand Campus Steneby. A new, international BFA programme in crafts, starting autumn term 2025, is being planned and the MFA programme Applied Arts and Design will be revised for admission to the autumn term 2026.**_

The master’s programme in Applied Arts and Design challenges how you perceive materials and space with three specializations: textile–body–space, wood-oriented furniture design, and metal art. You will develop critical perspectives in relation to society and current debates while pursuing your own projects in a hands-on and explorative process. As a student specializing in textile–body–space, you will take part in study trips, workshops, exhibitions, seminars, and lectures and reflect on your future role as an artist.

In the unique academic environment in Dals Långed, 170 kilometres north of Gothenburg, you will have access to some of Europe’s most well-equipped workshops, together with individual workplaces, computers, and software, empowering you to work wholeheartedly within your field. We have a long history of engagement in global and local society, with education in craft and design existing at our location since around 1930. Our programme is interdisciplinary and incorporates handicrafts, art, crafts, and design. Though you will focus on craft work in textile-body-space, you will work in a mutually beneficial learning environment with students of metal art and wood-oriented furniture design, all pursuing various methods of working with diverse materials.

### Material-led, hands-on and entrepreneurial approach

Our programme offers freedom to pursue projects formulated from your own ideas and requires a high degree of independence and personal motivation, with tutoring and supervision to support you. You will learn to relate to materials, body, and space through your material-based creative work, critical perspectives, and societal engagement, training you to move easily between practice and theory. We encourage you to develop your own style and voice and to pursue your own interests and goals for your future practice. Our highly international group works in close collaboration with the surrounding local community. This network allows mutually beneficial critiquing and an encouraging environment for solving problems. You will formulate your projects along with your professor in relevance to your course work and specialization.

### Specializing in textile–body–space

The specialization in textile–body–space is designed for you who want to work with textile art in relation to body and space. You will develop various techniques within the broad field of textiles such as knitting, textile printing, pleating, sewing, pattern making, weaving, embroidery, dyeing, and more. You will also develop a personal vocabulary for how you use these techniques that can be applied in relation to society and various contexts of art, craft, and design. Our programme prepares you for doctoral studies as well as working independently in the contexts of art and craft.

## Programme structure and content

The programme is project based and requires a high degree of autonomy, independence, and self-motivation. Projects are formulated together with your professor, and there are several opportunities to show your work at museums and galleries.

During the first year, you familiarize yourself with the workshops and machinery and begin your studio project. You will gain a basic understanding of research and entrepreneurship, expand your subject knowledge, formulate an action plan for your future practice, and build up your portfolio with projects.

The second year relates contemporary issues to your own work. You will write a background text and reflect on the context and form of presentation of your degree project. An external mentor will assist you during your degree project, and examinations include external opponents. The spring term ends with a degree exhibition.

## Who should apply?

Do you have a background in textiles and want to further explore the possibilities of the material from societal and critical perspectives?

Do you want to investigate and explore the artistic potential of textiles as a material?

Are you self-motivated and want to explore the context and develop the focus of your work?

Then apply for the master’s programme in Applied Arts and Design specializing in textile–body–space.
