## Summary

The master’s programme in Computer Science offers freedom and flexibility to choose among a wide range of courses. Computer science is a broad topic that spans everything from theory of computation to the practice of designing software systems. Our master’s programme utilizes the University of Gothenburg’s research-focused Department of Computer Science and Engineering to provide a comprehensive programme. As a student, you will explore the whole spectrum of computer science and specialize according to your interests.

## About

Computers are everywhere in society, with both beneficial and detrimental influence. With increasing connection and communication, however, the possibilities of misinformation, cyber-attacks, and breaches of privacy grow. On the other hand, aspects of life such as travel have never been more accessible, from air travel to self-driving cars. Algorithms steer our lives, influencing where we shop and what we buy, how we learn and how we communicate. At its core, computer science is the science of programming, studying the general powers and limitations of computing, the design and characteristics of hardware and software, and the solving of problems in applications of computers.

### A full-spectrum master’s programme

We have strong, internationally recognized research groups driving our programme, addressing a wide range of questions including the properties of electronic devices, the character of human reasoning, individual design components, globally distributed systems, fundamental understanding of computation, and highly pragmatic, applied research.

You can choose courses from a wide range of areas:

- algorithms and machine learning
- interaction design, computer graphics, and game design
- distributed computing and networks
- digital systems, computer architecture, and hardware verification
- security and privacy
- programming languages, formal logic, and dependent types
- real-time systems and dependability
- functional programming and parallel computing
- software engineering and program analysis
- natural language processing

### A unique opportunity for freedom and flexibility

Our programme is distinguished among others by offering you the opportunity to carve your own path through computer science. In contrast, other programmes often impose many mandatory courses and a rigid structure. In our programme, you will have only one mandatory course that will prepare you to start your master’s thesis. We have an exchange programme that allows you the opportunity to do half a year abroad at one of our partner universities, providing even more chances to broaden your experiences and studies.

### A diverse learning environment

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is shared between the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology and spans the two campuses, easily accessible by public transportation and integrated with the city. Our classroom environment is as flexible as your course options. Depending on the courses you choose, you will experience group and individual assignments, seminars, and project-focused work.

### A solid foundation in computer science from which you can go anywhere

You will be equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for a successful professional career in a large variety of information technology areas, both in industry and academia. In particular, the programme enables you as a future professional to conceive, design, and implement systems which work correctly, are maintainable, and reliable.

## Programme structure and content

The only mandatory course, The Computer Scientist in Society (designed to be taken in your second year), prepares you to start your master’s thesis. In this course, you practise academic writing and have the opportunity to use this time to complete your master’s thesis proposal if you wish.

The flexibility of the programme includes the opportunity to take courses outside of computer science as part of your degree, letting you create your own unique computer science profile according to your interests.

The last half-year is dedicated to your master’s thesis project, which is completed individually or in pairs. You may choose to collaborate with a company, though the focus should be on deepening what you have learned over the course of the master’s programme.

## Who should apply?

Would you like to combine thorough thinking with rapid experimentation?.

Do you want to explore the principles behind computer systems?

Do you want a wide variety of choice and to build your own path in computer science?

Then apply to the master’s programme in Computer Science.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

\## Entry requirements

A bachelor's degree of 180 credits within the field of computer science or equivalent, including a thesis or project of at least 6 credits.

At least 120 credits in total in computer science and mathematics, of which at least

\- 7\\.5 credits discrete mathematics, and 10 additional credits in mathematics,

\- 7\\.5 credits imperative or object oriented programming, and 7.5 additional credits in programming, as well as

\- 7\\.5 credits data structures

(or equivalent).

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6 / English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

\## Specific entry requirements for admission to a course within the study programme

Within the study programme there can be specific entry requirements for admission to individual courses. These specific entry requirements are documented in each course syllabus and state which entry requirements are necessary to be registered on a course within the study programme.

\## Selection

Selection is according to the Higher Education Ordinance and the University of Gothenburg admission regulations for education on first and second cycle.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive the Degree of Master of Science with a major in Computer Science.

After graduation, you will be highly qualified to work as a programmer, systems architect, system developer, and project leader, or to undertake research in computer science. Our emphasis on modelling, design, and on conceptual abilities will provide you with flexibility, so you can adapt to emerging and evolving job markets.

International and local industry appreciate the high skills and broad profile of our graduates, some of whom have gone to work at large companies such as Ericsson, Apple, and Google, while others have been part of start-ups.
