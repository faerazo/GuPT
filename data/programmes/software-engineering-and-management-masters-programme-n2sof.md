## Summary

Software is a driving force for innovation and development, and its importance in society as a whole is rapidly increasing. As a student of the master’s programme in Software Engineering and Management, you will develop a combination of advanced technical knowledge and management skills within software development—competence highly sought after in the job market. After successfully completing the programme, you will be able to apply to roles such as project manager, developer, tester, and quality manager in a wide variety of industries.

## About

The growing use of software also increases the size and complexity of software needed, alongside greater pressure to quickly release to market in rapidly changing environments and demands. To meet these challenges, the master’s programme in Software Engineering and Management offers a unique combination of advanced technical knowledge and management skills. You will develop perspectives for:

- understanding industrial practices and current and future trends in technology development;
- judging and improving software quality, methods, and tools;
- sustaining software systems over long times;
- and innovating software development practices and improving performance.

[Watch our video about the programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l9GannrcnU)

### A project-based, collaborative learning environment

We have a strong research profile and rely on close collaboration with industry. You will engage in project work and be confronted with real-world challenges for software-intensive industries. Addressing these challenges will show you how both advanced technical knowledge and managerial skills are needed to produce large technologically advanced systems in ways that correspond to contemporary demands for quality and speed in very dynamic environments.

### Preparing you for a future career

The programme combines different perspectives and approaches, preparing you for different roles, such as developer, tester, quality manager, software architect, and project manager. The skills you develop will also be applicable in many industries, such as automotive, telecom, defence, government, bank, retail, and education. We educate future engineers who are qualified to design software with high quality and low development and maintenance costs. But we also educate future researchers who can work innovatively and conduct advanced experiments with technology within software engineering.

### We help you succeed

You will have the opportunity to do an industrial practice project, which is 15 credits gained during an internship with a company. Furthermore, you may conduct your master’s thesis in collaboration with a company. The master's programme in Software Engineering and Management has been selected by the Swedish Institute to nominate candidates for scholarships. Please visit the webpages of the Swedish Institute for more information on how to apply for a scholarship.

## Programme structure and content

The master’s programme in Software Engineering and Management offers a combination of advanced technical knowledge and management skills. It consists of mandatory courses providing a solid foundation in central areas of software engineering, elective courses enabling you to specialize in your personal fields of interest, and a final master’s thesis. You will learn how to identify the best available methods and tools, become knowledgeable about the industrial field of software engineering, and practise group research activities.

The programme allows you to specialize your education into a unique profile by choosing among elective courses within applied information technology, computer science, or information systems. In the third semester, you will engage in a real project that synthesizes and applies your knowledge from previous courses and makes a concrete contribution to existing software. The programme culminates with your master’s thesis, an opportunity for further specialization.

## Who should apply?

Are you interested in developing high quality software systems, ready for use in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous cars?

Do you want to manage software projects that have a real positive impact on users?

Do you want to design systems today that can adapt to tomorrow’s demands and can be sustained over many years?

If you want to become a professional software engineer who can contribute constructively to both software intensive industries and society, then apply for the master’s programme in Software Engineering and Management.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Entry requirements

Bachelor?s degree 180 credits including an independent project (degree project) of at least 6 credits or equivalent within the field of Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, or equivalent.

Knowledge in programming, with the minimum of:

12 credits in programming, of which at least 6 credits must include object-oriented programming (Java, Python, C#, or an equivalent language).

6 credits in algorithms and data structures.

Applicants must prove their knowledge of English: English 6/English B from Swedish Upper Secondary School or the equivalent level of an internationally recognized test, for example TOEFL, IELTS.

### Selection

Selection is based upon the number of credits from previous university studies, maximum 165 credits.

## After graduation

Graduates of the programme receive a degree of Master of Science with a major in Software Engineering.

You will be equipped for further academic studies at the doctoral level or to enter different roles involved in the development of software, such as developer, tester, quality manager, software architect, and project manager.

Examples of companies where our alumni work are Ericsson, Volvo, IBM, Sigma IT Consulting, ABB, NASDAQ, Saab, and HiQ.

## Facilities

The master's programme is given by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Division of Software Engineering, which is located in the middle of Sweden's leading technology hub, Lindholmen Science Park, close to the city center in Gothenburg.
