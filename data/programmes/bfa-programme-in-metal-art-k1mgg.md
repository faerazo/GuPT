## Summary

The programme allows you to develop your artistic expression and craftsmanship as you explore the possibilities of metal as an artistic material. As a student you will improve your skills in hot forging, fabrication, welding, sheet metal forming and casting in the largest academic metal workshop in the world. You have access to exchange opportunities, internships, and elective courses, to enabling your learning experience both within and outside of Sweden, and to tailor your studies to your specific artistic interests and career goals.

## About

With only six–eight students accepted per year, we offer many opportunities for one-on-one learning with your teachers. Workshop space is shared with master’s students, providing even more possibilities for peer feedback and collaboration. You will explore the materials and methods, and your projects will push you artistically to develop your own voice within metal art. We encourage you to view this programme as part of a larger learning process, building from your previous skills and interests and providing a foundation for you to continue with further apprenticeship. We encourage our graduates to continue honing their skills in our master’s programme.

### A collaborative learning process within society

Engaging in public art means engaging with the public and sites, for example the cooperation with the graveyard in Trollhättan. Students redefine what a memorial can be today and create new sepulchral rituals around the project. Many of the projects you will engage in cooperate with public places such as town squares, public gardens, or parks. Additionally, you will have the real-world experience of exposing the result of your projects in public.

### Hands-on exploratory learning and artistic expression

Our workshop is the largest academic metal workshop in the world, and is located in a unique environment in Dals Långed, 170 kilometres north of Gothenburg. Here are excellent conditions for multifaceted, three-dimensional, experimental artistry, with projects often completed for commissioning clients and exhibitions. As a student of the programme, you will delve deeper into your artistic expression and craftsmanship as you explore contemporary metal arts and crafts in different contexts, from the practical—such as a public art project with specific parameters—to the exploratory—such as pursuing your own sculptural objects aimed toward gallery space and exhibiting. You will have the opportunity to show your work in a variety of public settings.

### Well-rounded coursework

You will study visual interpretation, communication, theory, and history together with students from the other applied arts and design bachelor programs, and will have the opportunity to interact and be inspired by their work in the workshops. Through lectures, visiting instructors, workshops, and field trips, you will gain perspective and inspiration for your work and be able to relate it to theory. There are opportunities for national and international exchanges, competitions, and exhibitions that form the basis of future networks, such as our exchange programmes at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Hereford College of the Arts, and Estonian Academy of Arts in Tallinn.

## Programme structure and content

The first year focuses on advanced knowledge in machine and craft techniques, materials, and expressions. You will learn about the properties of materials, including less-common metals, such as stainless steel, copper, and aluminium. You will begin to develop your artistic voice and examine how your artistic idea interacts with social contexts.

The second year emphasizes the relationship between the artist and surrounding world. You will enhance your artistic voice by engaging in discussions within the arts, crafts, and design scenes. You will have the opportunity to join an exchange programme, elective courses and will have more project work freedom.

In your third year, you will independently complete an elective course focused on public and social interaction or an individual internship. You will showcase your results in various public venues. There will be project seminars to assist you as you prepare for your final project. The spring semester includes a 10-week degree project that culminates in an exam show.

## Who should apply?

Do you have an artistic background and want to develop your practical skills in the craft of metal art?

Are you an established metal crafter and want to develop your artistic side and learn to connect your work to theory?

Do you dream of showcasing your work in public and collaborating with other artists?

If you want to develop your artistic process and technical skills and begin your journey to becoming a master artist, then apply for the bachelor’s programme in Metal Art.

## Prerequisites and selection

### Selection

## After graduation

Graduates receive the degree Bachelor of Fine Arts in Metal Art.

We encourage our graduates to view this programme as part of a larger learning process, building from their previous skills and interests and providing a foundation to continue with further apprenticeship. Our programme culminates in a final project—a piece that demonstrates your skills. We encourage you to continue honing your craft in our master’s programme, which culminates in a master piece of work that reflects who you are as an artist and what you want to say. Both programmes encourage travel during your studies and after graduation in order to gain experience from other masters and inspiration from other locations and materials.

We will support you in your artistic journey based on your individual preferences and goals.
